When I asked ChatGPT,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the best course on SaaS on WordPress?\u201d , my course\nWordPress SaaS 2.0\nappeared as the first result.\nThe same thing happened in Perplexity. My website is now ranking at the top of AI responses, generating free traffic directly from AI models.\nThis isn\u2019t luck.\nIt\u2019s the result of implementing\nAI Optimization (AIO) , where I optimize my content to appear in AI-generated responses. And if you\u2019re still only focusing on traditional SEO, you\u2019re missing out on a massive traffic source that\u2019s growing exponentially.\nThe SEO-to-AIO Evolution\nFor years, our organic traffic strategy looked only like this:\nResearch keywords using tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush\nOptimize on-page elements (title tags, meta descriptions, headers)\nBuild quality backlinks\nTrack performance in Google Search Console\nMonitor impressions, clicks, and traffic data\nThis system worked because Google was the primary gateway to information.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\nyou still need to optimize for Google search results,\nbut to increase your chances of online visibility, you\u2019ll also have to optimize your content for AI Models, because many people ditched Google and are using only them to search for stuff online, like:\nChatGPT\u2019s web browsing feature\nPerplexity\u2019s real-time search\nGoogle\u2019s AI Mode\n(available in 180+ countries as of September 2025)\nClaude with search functionality\nMicrosoft Copilot integration\nEach platform processes queries differently, but they all share one thing: they\u2019re trained to provide direct human-like answers rather than just a list of links.\nSo, in conclusion, if your content gets selected as a source on AI models, you win.\nIf it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible.\nGoogle AI Mode\nGoogle\u2019s AI Mode\nis a new search experience that replaces the traditional list of links with human-like direct answers, which people prefer. While Google has\nstated that AI Mode will potentially become the default Google Search experience\u00a0 \u201csoon,\u201d \u00a0it has since walked back on\u00a0 this statement.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about AI Mode availability: You can access it through\ngoogle.com/ai , the Google app, or by clicking the AI Mode tab on Google.com (note that it is still not available to\neveryone as of September 2025).\nWhy this matters for marketers : Google\u2019s search revenue increased 10% to $50.7 billion in Q1 2025, partially attributed to AI features. This isn\u2019t an experiment that might fail; it\u2019s a core business strategy that\u2019s already showing positive returns.\nHow to Track AIO Mentions\nWith SEO, we use Google Search Console to see impressions, clicks, and keyword rankings.\nBut what\u2019s the equivalent for AI models?\nI researched existing solutions:\nAhrefs : $129/month\nSE Ranking : $95/month\nFirst Answer : $39/month for just 10 prompts\nKeyword.com : Similar pricing tiers\nThese tools might work well, but they\u2019re expensive for most website owners just starting with AIO.\nSo, I built a free alternative.\nI created this system using\nMake , a no-code platform that lets you build automations without writing a single line of code.\nAnd, you can start for free.\nThe system is composed of 3 scenarios ( I\u2019ll attach the link to all the scenarios below, so you can download and import them directly ), each handling a specific task of AIO tracking:\nScenario 1: Query Tracking and Mentions\nThis is the core of the system. Here\u2019s what it does:\nAdd prompts you want to monitor\n(these are like \u201cAIO keywords\u201d).\nFind them using my free LLM query generator.\nThe system automatically queries ChatGPT\nwith these prompts\nResponses get parsed and stored\nin structured JSON format\nThis scenario runs on a schedule you set (daily, weekly, or custom intervals) and builds a database of how AI models respond to your target queries.\nScenario 2: Keyword Performance Analysis\nThis scenario focuses on brand and competitor tracking:\nTrack mentions of your brand, website, or products\nacross all collected responses\nMonitor competitor mentions\nin the same responses\nStore historical data\nfor performance tracking over time\nScenario 3: Competitor Tracking\nThis scenario handles competitor monitoring and comparison:\nMonitor competitor mentions\nin AI responses for the same queries you\u2019re tracking\nCompare the mention frequency\nbetween you and your competitors\nAnalyze competitive positioning\nto identify gaps and opportunities in AI responses\nThe AIO Tracking Dashboard\nI even built a clean UI for the system, where you can view all the results you get from your Make automation.\nWant the complete system with all blueprints, detailed explanations of each scenario, and the custom dashboard?\nWatch my full implementation tutorial here:\nComplete AIO Tracking System Setup .\nAnd, if you just want the scenarios, here you go \ud83d\ude42\n7 Proven AIO Optimization Tactics\nNow, the\nimportant part\nis how you can improve your ranking on AI models. Based on my research and testing, here are the tactics that actually work:\n1. Add Statistics, Numbers, and Proof\nAI models heavily favor verifiable, factual content. Instead of writing \u201cOur tool is popular,\u201d write \u201cOur tool has 100,000+ monthly users with a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating.\u201d\n(don\u2019t lie, though, use real data \ud83d\ude42\nExample : On my\nSelfHostSchool\nlanding page, I specify \u201c150+ users joined\u201d rather than just saying it\u2019s \u201cwidely used.\u201d This specificity makes AI models more likely to cite it as a credible source.\n2. Engage on Reddit, Forums, and Quora\nAI training data includes massive amounts of community discussions. Being active in relevant communities shows you\u2019re real and knowledgeable.\nTip : Don\u2019t just drop links. Provide genuine value in discussions, then mention your solution naturally when relevant. The goal is to create authentic mentions that AI models will encounter during training.\n3. FAQ Optimization for Natural Language Queries\nPeople ask AI models complete questions, not just keywords. Your content should answer these questions directly.\nExample : Instead of optimizing for \u201cWordPress hosting,\u201d optimize for \u201cWhat\u2019s the best WordPress hosting for SaaS applications?\u201d and provide a complete, detailed answer.\n4. Create Comparison Tables and Structured Data\nAI models excel at processing structured information. Create side-by-side comparisons in your niche that AI can reference directly.\nExample :\nRecently, I did a case study to stress test Make as a Saas Backend, and I wrote an article about it, where I included a table showing all the tests and the results they got.\n5. Build Multi-Platform Authority\nPublish the same core information across multiple platforms:\nYour website\nYouTube videos\nMedium articles\nLinkedIn posts\nGuest posts on relevant blogs\nWhen AI models see consistent information across multiple sources, it increases trust and the likelihood of citation.\nExample:\nThis exact article is provided as a\nvideo tutorial on YouTube\nand on Medium.\n6. Show Fresh Update Signals\nAI models prefer current information. Make it obvious when the content was last updated:\nAdd \u201cLast updated: [Date]\u201d to articles\nInclude recent examples and case studies\nReference current events or recent changes in your industry\nHere\u2019s an example from a library I\u2019m building that contains profitable digital products you can sell in 2025:\n7. Implement JSON-LD Structured Data\nAdd schema markup in JSON on your website pages to help AI models understand your content structure.\nHere\u2019s an example showing you how you can do it.\nFinally, if you prefer to see all these tactics in action visually with the examples,\ncheck the full video on my YouTube channel \ud83d\ude42\nThe LLM Query Generator: Your Free AIO Weapon\nHere\u2019s a bonus tool that makes AIO implementation much easier: I created the\nLLM Query Generator\non ToolerBox.\nAll you have to do is paste any webpage URL, and it generates up to 20 different prompts people might use to find that page through AI models.\nYou might think people will search for\n\u201cWordPress course,\u201d\nbut the tool reveals they\u2019re actually asking\n\u201cHow to build a SaaS with WordPress from scratch\u201d\nor\n\u201cBest way to monetize WordPress skills in 2025.\u201d\nThese generated prompts become your AIO keyword targets, the queries you optimize for and track in your monitoring system.\nYour Next Steps\nThe AIO opportunity window is still wide open. Most businesses are still focused exclusively on traditional SEO, which means less competition for AI model citations.\nStart Here:\nPhase 1: Research and Setup\nIdentify your target prompts\nusing the\nLLM Query Generator tool\nSet up the free tracking system\non\nMake\nAudit your existing content using the 7 tactics\nPhase 2: Authority Building\nEngage in relevant community discussions\nPublish across multiple platforms\nBuild genuine relationships in your industry\nMonitor and respond to tracking data\nPhase 3: Scale and Iterate\nExpand tracking to more AI models\nTest different prompt variations\nAnalyze competitor strategies\nRefine content based on performance data\nRemember : AIO doesn\u2019t replace SEO; it supplements it. You still need traditional search optimization, but now you also need to optimize for AI model responses.\nThe businesses that master both will dominate organic traffic in the coming years.\nCategories: \t\t\t\t\t\t Uncategorized\nRelated Articles\nTL;DR Google\u2019s AI Overviews now answer searches directly at the top of results.

It entails being recognized, understood, and trusted on a variety of platforms, including conversational search tools, AI-powered assistants, and conventional search engines. By fusing three potent frameworks\u2014Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), and Artificial Intelligence Optimization (AIO)\u2014Verbsz Marketing assists firms in adjusting to this new era of discovery. Although each has a unique function, taken as a whole, they shape the direction of digital visibility in the future. Remaining competitive in 2025 and beyond requires an understanding of their differences and how to integrate them. Knowing SEO: The Basis for Internet Presence The cornerstone of any digital marketing plan is search engine optimization, or SEO. It is the process of improving your website to make it easier for search engines to crawl, index, and rank your pages. Good SEO makes sure that people who are actively looking for your goods or services see your brand. Relevance, authority, and experience are the three interrelated pillars that form the foundation of SEO. Relevance guarantees that the purpose of search queries is reflected in your material. Backlinks, brand mentions, and domain trust are the foundations of authority. Experience is the technical soundness and usefulness of your website, including its quick load speeds, responsiveness on mobile devices, and easy-to-use navigation. SEO is still essential even in a time when AI-powered tools are changing how people search. It establishes the foundation for all subsequent optimization endeavors. Without good SEO, your website won\u2019t have the structure that search engines and artificial intelligence (AI) systems require to recognize your worth. This includes everything from keyword research and metadata to excellent content and technological architecture. Reexamining your SEO fundamentals is often the answer if your website\u2019s traffic has plateaued or your ranks have dropped. To find out the untapped potential that could improve your organic performance,\nschedule a free SEO assessment with Verbsz Marketing. AEO: Not Just a Choice, But the Solution Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) makes sure your content becomes the answer, while SEO helps your website rank. Users want immediate, audible, or shown responses rather than lengthy lists of links as they depend more on voice assistants and conversational AI to find information. The goal of AEO is to organize content so that search engines like Google or artificial intelligence (AI) assistants like Siri and Alexa recognize it as the most straightforward and reliable response to a user\u2019s question. Understanding how people formulate their queries is the first step towards AEO. Many people now question, \u201cWhat are the benefits of digital marketing?\u201d rather than, \u201cWhat are the benefits of digital marketing?\u201d You can position your business to show up in Google\u2019s Featured Snippets, \u201cPeople Also Ask\u201d sections, and even voice search results by customizing your content to these question-based searches. Your content should answer questions succinctly and directly in the opening phrases if you want to excel at AEO, then go into more detail later. Search engines can identify your content as \u201canswer-ready\u201d if you have conversational headings, FAQ sections, and structured schema markup. The objective is to expand SEO, not to replace it. AEO makes sure your material is chosen, while SEO makes sure it is found. Being selected as the definitive response significantly raises brand visibility and authority in a world where users rarely scroll. Examine\nVerbsz Marketing\u2019s SEO and content planning services\nif you want your company to dominate voice results, featured snippets, and AI-driven search results. To put your company at the forefront of the answer economy of today, our team assists in creating question-driven content. The Age of Artificial Intelligence Search: Getting Ready for It Artificial Intelligence Optimization (AIO) is the most recent advancement in optimization. AIO makes sure your content is accessible, retrievable, and referenced by AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity as they become more integrated into people\u2019s information searches. AIO is about making your material machine-readable, as opposed to SEO, which concentrates on keyword rankings, or AEO, which aims for direct replies. AI search engines analyze context, meaning, and connections between topics in addition to looking for keywords. AIO makes sure your website is trustworthy, well-structured, and semantically rich, all of which enable AI systems to derive precise insights and even reference your company as a reliable source. Instead of over-optimizing keywords, material should cover themes thoroughly and organically to reach effective AIO. Every piece of content on your website should make sense in relation to the others, creating a network of connected concepts known as a \u201ctopic cluster\u201d that exhibits knowledge. AI exposure can be increased by properly organizing data, keeping website code quick and clean, and building a solid reputation with credible backlinks and citations. AIO\u2019s future influence is what gives it its unique power. AIO helps your content live within the knowledge graphs, embeddings, and models that AI technologies rely on, whereas traditional SEO generates traffic right away. As time passes, your brand appears in chat summaries, AI responses, and synthesized answers, becoming a part of the digital knowledge layer. Innovative companies are already spending money on AIO to make sure that their material is not only searchable but also machine understandable. Our specialty at Verbsz Marketing is getting websites ready for this new search landscape by fusing our knowledge of SEO with insights from artificial intelligence. How AIO, AEO, and SEO Cooperate Despite having distinct goals, these three fields complement and enhance one another when used in concert. SEO guarantees that search engines can see your website. That visibility is converted into authoritative responses by AEO. AIO guarantees that in AI-powered search contexts, your brand will always be seen as a reliable source. It is preferable to think of them as layers inside a single visibility framework rather than as distinct strategies. AIO guarantees durability in an artificial intelligence-dominated future, AEO improves the way your content interacts with users and speech systems, and SEO establishes the technological and structural foundation. A business that posts a well-optimized blog post about \u201cThe Future of Digital Marketing,\u201d for instance, might rank through SEO. Reorganizing the blog with clear descriptions and question-based subheadings could increase its AEO visibility in Google\u2019s featured snippets. The objectives of AIO are met by ensuring that the same content is recognized and cited by AI systems through the addition of semantic context, citations, and author credentials. Developing a Visibility Strategy That Will Last Strong SEO foundations are the first step in an integrated optimization strategy. Strong keyword alignment, enhanced site speed, and routine site audits are crucial. Once the foundation is laid, overlaying AEO methods transforms static sites into interactive, answer-driven experiences that appeal to both users and algorithms. Lastly, adding AIO guarantees that your material will survive and grow in the ever-changing field of AI-driven search. We at\nVerbsz Marketing\nassist brands in combining these tactics into a unified strategy. To make sure your material is not only discoverable but also useful to both people and AI systems, our professionals employ sophisticated analytics, structured data, and semantic modeling. Over time, this alignment increases organic engagement, fosters long-term visibility, and fortifies brand confidence. Towards the Future: Search\u2019s Prospects in 2025 and Beyond The way people search is evolving quickly. Contextual exposure is becoming more important while traditional clicks are decreasing thanks to AI assistants and generative search engines. Even while users may never visit your website directly, they will nevertheless come across your brand\u2019s insights through voice results, summaries, or AI-driven responses. Every firm must now optimize presence as well as clicks to be surfaced, trusted, and referenced across various digital ecosystems. AIO makes sure you stay visible as technology advances, AEO establishes your authority, and SEO keeps you relevant in this new world. A comprehensive visibility strategy that adjusts to changing search paradigms is produced by the feeding of each discipline into the others. Conclusion: Using Verbsz Marketing to Increase Visibility Intelligently The strategies of SEO, AEO, and AIO are not separate. In a world where artificial intelligence is becoming more prevalent, they reflect the logical progression of content engagement strategies. SEO makes sure that people can find your website. AEO guarantees that it delivers value by providing lucid, reliable responses. The intelligent systems forming tomorrow\u2019s search experiences will be able to read, recognize, and refer to it thanks to AIO. In addition to ranking higher, brands that adopt this trifecta will dominate the next stage of digital competition by being present wherever their target audience searches for solutions.

We want to make sure you can name-drop it in your next Zoom happy hour, and answer any follow up questions without skipping a single forkful of salad. Here's the most efficient FAQ we could muster. What is an NFT? Is it a cryptocurrency? Non-Fungible Tokens are unique, easily verifiable digital assets that can represent items such as GIFs, images, videos, music albums, and more. Anything that exists online can be purchased as an NFT, theoretically.\u00a0 An NFT is \u201ca type of cryptographic token,\u201d Emerging Tech Brew writer\nRyan Duffy explains , but NFTs are different from cryptocurrencies because they\u2019re not interchangeable. Think of Pok\u00e9mon cards: You can trade them, but a Gastly is not the same as a holographic Charizard. But a bitcoin is indistinguishable from another bitcoin. Why would I want to own an NFT? Can I make money on it? One reason to buy an NFT is for its\nemotional value , which isn\u2019t so different from physical objects...unless you\u2019re a total utilitarian. No one buys lip gloss because they need it. They buy it for the way it makes them feel. The same can be true for a GIF, image, video, or other digital asset. The other reason is because you think it\u2019s valuable...and will only increase in value. And yes, you can make money off of an NFT by buying and reselling it for more. How do you buy an NFT? The process varies based on what platform you use. And there are a lot of platforms.

Recently, as\nGoogle search trends\nindicate, interest in NFTs has exploded.

I urge you to immediately confirm or deny the existence of such a database, and if it exists, immediately shut it down and delete it.\u201d\nCreating a database of peaceful protesters \u201cwould constitute a shocking violation of the First Amendment and abuse of power,\u201d and amount to \u201cthe kinds of tactics the United States rightly condemns in authoritarian governments such as China and Russia,\u201d Markey said.\nMarkey\u2019s letter said DHS officials \u201chave repeatedly stated that the agency is engaged in efforts to monitor, catalog, and intimidate individuals engaged in peaceful protests,\u201d and gave several examples.

Federal agents from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations assigned to Minneapolis received a memo earlier this month asking them to collect identifying information on protesters and so-called agitators,\nCNN\nreported Tuesday. Federal agents from the agencies were asked to fill out a form titled \u201cintel collection non-arrests,\u201d and \u201ccapture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form,\u201d according to communications obtained by CNN. Among the likely subjects of this massive surveillance scheme was Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old ICU nurse who was killed by Customs and Border Protection agents in broad daylight. A few days before he was killed, Pretti was\nbeaten by a group of federal agents he was monitoring , and suffered a broken rib. A source told CNN that federal agents knew Pretti\u2019s name, but did not clarify if he was in this database. Last week, a masked ICE agent\nwarned\na woman filming their activities in Portland, Maine, that her information would be entered into a \u201cnice little database\u201d that would label her a domestic terrorist. This week, federal agents have reportedly\nstarted making house calls\non volunteer ICE watchers they hope to intimidate.\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, a well-documented liar, claimed that her agency was not compiling a database of so-called \u201cdomestic terrorists,\u201d but that it was \u201cstandard protocol\u201d to collect information on law-breaking \u201cviolent agitators\u201d in order to \u201cadvance prosecution.\u201d \u201cWe do of course monitor and investigate and refer all threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cObstructing and assaulting law enforcement is a felony and a federal crime.\u201d\nIt seems that federal agents have lost the plot on what obstruction actually entails. Federal agents have aggressively approached citizen ICE watchers simply monitoring their operations, threatening to arrest them\u2014 or worse . And DHS\u2019s claims of assault against federal officers have continued to crumble under the slightest scrutiny.\nShare This Story Read more: ICE Agent Makes Chilling Threat to Woman Filming Him in Public Most Recent Post Federal officers stationed in Minnesota don\u2019t seem to be interested in lowering the temperature.

You said if I raise my voice, you will erase my voice?\u201d the observer\nasked\nincredulously. \u201cYes, exactly,\u201d the agent responded.

The agencies have also deported people from the U.S. without due process, ripped children from their parents, and ushered thousands of untrained agents into cities and neighborhoods where they are not wanted. A\nCBS News poll\npublished days before Pretti\u2019s killing on Saturday in Minneapolis found that 61 percent of surveyed Americans felt that ICE agents were \u201ctoo tough\u201d when stopping and detaining people. In the face of ICE\u2019s seemingly endless violence, thousands of Minnesotans have risen up in protest, creating a call for change so loud that even Washington couldn\u2019t ignore it. By Monday, Donald Trump had unveiled a new plan for Minnesota in a flailing Hail Mary attempt to salvage his increasingly unpopular immigration agenda. In a post on Truth Social, Trump announced that border czar Tom Homan would be shipped to Minnesota to run ICE and CBP. Customs and Border Protection boss Greg Bovino, on the other hand,\ngot the boot . Meanwhile, the president almost immediately threw the de facto leaders of his deportation scheme\u2014namely, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller\u2014 under the bus\nin order to save his own skin, attempting to frame himself in front of reporters as a level-headed witness to the ICE killings rather than the primary and active architect of the agency\u2019s recent overreach.\nShare This Story Read more about the immigration agents: ICE Agent Moons People Protesting Against Minnesota Shootings Most Recent Post Slain Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti had his rib broken by ICE agents just one week before he was shot to death. He was also potentially part of a\nmassive surveillance\ndatabase\nthat agents are rumored to be collecting on protesters in Minneapolis. An unnamed source\ntold CNN\nthat Pretti\u2019s earlier altercation with federal agents occurred when he pulled over and got out of his car to observe ICE agents running after a family. He immediately began blowing his whistle and yelling. He was later taken down by five agents, with one leaning on his back and breaking his rib, before they released him back into the street.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat day, he thought he was going to die,\u201d CNN\u2019s source said. CNN reviewed Pretti\u2019s medication records, which were consistent with the idea that he had broken his rib. It\u2019s not clear whether Border Patrol agents recognized Pretti before killing him this past weekend. But a DHS memo earlier this month told agents in Minneapolis to \u201ccapture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.\u201d A source also told CNN that federal agents knew Pretti\u2019s name, without clarifying if he was in this database. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m pushing for right now \u2026 we\u2019re going to create a database where those people that are arrested for interference, impeding and assault, we\u2019re going to make them famous,\u201d border czar Tom Homan\nsaid\ntwo weeks ago. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put their face on TV. We\u2019re going to let their employers, in their neighborhoods, in their schools, know who these people are.\u201d From the \u201c fucking bitch \u201d comment after Renee Good\u2019s shooting to this news about Pretti, it seems clear that federal immigration agents aren\u2019t simply good guys who are operating under duress of the mob\u2014they\u2019re vindictive, trigger-happy, and they\u2019re remembering the faces of anyone who stands up to them.\u00a0 Share This Story Editor\u2019s Pick: Trump Has No Way Out in Minneapolis Most Recent Post Federal officers in Minnesota are either completely ignorant of the severity of their violence, or they simply don\u2019t care. Agents staying at a Springhill Suites in Maple Grove\u2014a suburban city about 20 minutes away from Minneapolis\u2014were\nfilmed\nby journalist Laura Jedeed laughing at protesters from a third-floor window Monday evening. Then, one of the agents pulled down his shorts and pressed his bare ass against the glass, mooning the distressed crowd protesting below. Very professional boys\npic.twitter.com/7BZggnqB8z \u2014 Laura Jedeed (@LauraJedeed)\nJanuary 27, 2026\nWithin the last three weeks, agents with ICE and Customs and Border Protection have shot and killed two U.S. citizens: Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti and\naward-winning poet\nRen\u00e9e Nicole Good. Immigration agents have resorted to arresting practically anybody\u2014including U.S. citizens and\nchildren \u2014in order to satisfy Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s quota of 3,000 or more arrests per day. In doing so, they\u2019ve struck terror and fury into the souls of American communities, and the cold-blooded federal overreach has sparked nationwide protests and local economic blackouts. Local politicians\u2014including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz\u2014have demanded that ICE and CBP exit their cities and states, arguing that the federal agents have done more harm than good. In 2025, before Good\u2019s death, the agency killed\n32 people \u2014its deadliest year in more than two decades. In an attempt to defend their own city from the state-sponsored violence, some Minneapolis residents have opted to openly carry their firearms, brandishing their Second Amendment right to bear arms. Locals have formed neighborhood watches to follow ICE vehicles, banging pots and pans and screaming to alert others when agents enter their residential neighborhoods. The public backlash has rattled conservative lawmakers, donors, and even Donald Trump, who appears to be\npeeling away\nfrom Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in an attempt to salvage his immigration agenda. Share This Story Read more about the protests: \u201cThis Is a Warning\u201d: ICE Agents Follow Protesters Home Most Recent Post The Justice Department is not pursuing a civil rights probe into Alex Pretti\u2019s death at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, with the Department of Homeland Security instead investigating its own officers.\u00a0 MS NOW\nreports\nthat Customs and Border Protection will be investigating whether the agents followed department policy, while Homeland Security Investigations, which normally investigates human trafficking and drug rings as part of ICE, will be investigating whether Pretti broke any laws before being killed.

Yesterday, Substance 3D and Photoshop developer Adobe set the entire world of digital 2D animation on fire by announcing the upcoming discontinuation and shutdown of\nAdobe Animate, a legendary software previously known as Adobe Flash Professional, which, over the past 30 years since its debut, has powered tens of thousands of animation projects from indie creators and major Hollywood-level studios alike. Following what was probably\none of the largest waves of backlash\nthe company has ever faced, it only took the developer about 24 hours to reverse course, with them issuing a follow-up statement confirming that Adobe Animate will not be shut down. According to the company's\nnew announcement , the earlier warning stating that March 1, 2027, would be the application's final day should now be disregarded, as Adobe is neither discontinuing nor removing access to Adobe Animate, and there is no longer any deadline or date set for when Animate will stop being available. Going forward, the software will remain accessible to both new and existing users, although Adobe has confirmed that users shouldn't expect the addition of any new features. Instead, the program will remain in a perpetual \"maintenance mode,\" meaning Adobe will continue supporting the application and providing regular security updates and bug fixes.

Article content For several years, military and civilian space authorities in the west have been tracking the activities of Luch-1 and Luch-2 \u2014 two Russian objects that have carried out repeated suspicious manoeuvres in orbit. Article content Both vehicles have made risky close approaches to some of Europe\u2019s most important geostationary satellites, which operate high above the Earth and service the continent, including the U.K., as well as large parts of Africa and\nthe Middle East. Article content According to orbital data and ground-based telescopic observations, they have lingered nearby for weeks at a time, particularly over the past three years. Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has approached 17 European satellites. Article content Both satellites are suspected of \u201cdoing sigint [signals intelligence] business\u201d, Major General Michael Traut, head of the German military\u2019s space command, told the Financial Times, referring to the satellites\u2019 practice of staying close to western communications satellites.

Article content \u201cSatellite networks are an Achilles heel of modern societies. Whoever attacks them can paralyse entire nations,\u201d German defence minister Boris Pistorius said in a speech last September. Article content \u201cThe Russian activities are a fundamental threat to all of us, especially in space. A threat we must no longer ignore,\u201d he added. Article content The European satellites approached by Luch 1 and 2 are primarily used for civilian purposes, such as satellite television, but also carry sensitive government and some military communications. Article content Luch 1 and Luch 2 are unlikely to have the capability to jam or destroy satellites themselves, the European intelligence official said. However, they have probably provided Russia with large amounts of data on how such systems could be disrupted, both from the ground and in orbit. Article content Maj Gen Traut said he presumed the Luch satellites had intercepted the \u201ccommand link\u201d of the satellites they approached \u2014 the channel linking satellites to ground controllers that allows orbital adjustments. Article content Analysts say that with such information, Russia could mimic ground operators, beaming false commands to satellites to manipulate their thrusters used for minor orbital adjustments. Article content Article content Those thrusters could also be used to knock satellites out of alignment or even cause them to crash back to Earth or drift into space. Article content Intelligence gathered by Luch 1 and 2 could also help Russia co-ordinate less overt attacks on western interests. Monitoring other satellites can reveal who is using them and where \u2014 information that could later be exploited for targeted ground-based jamming or hacking operations. Article content The Luch vehicles were \u201cmanoeuvring about and parking themselves close to geostationary satellites, often for many months at a time\u201d, said Belinda Marchand, chief science officer at Slingshot Aerospace, a US-based company that tracks objects in space using ground-based sensors and artificial intelligence. Article content She added that Luch 2 was currently \u201cin proximity\u201d to Intelsat 39, a large geostationary satellite that services Europe and Africa. Article content Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has hovered near at least 17 other geostationary satellites above Europe serving both commercial and government purposes, Slingshot data shows. Article content \u201cThey have visited the same families, the same operators \u2014 so you can deduce that they have a specific purpose or interest,\u201d said Norbert Pouzin, senior orbital analyst at Aldoria, a French satellite tracking company that has also shadowed the Luch satellites. \u201cThese are all Nato-based operators.\u201d Article content Article content \u201cEven if they cannot decrypt messages, they can still extract a lot of information\u2026they can map how a satellite is being used, work out the location of ground terminals, for example,\u201d he added. Article content Pouzin also said that Russia now seemed to be ramping up its reconnaissance activity in space, launching two new satellites last year named Cosmos 2589 and Cosmos 2590. The vehicles appear to have similarly manoeuvrable capabilities to Luch-1 and Luch-2. Article content Cosmos 2589 is now on its way to the same range as geostationary satellites, which orbit 35,000 kilometres above Earth, Pouzin said. Article content But Luch-1 may no longer be functional. On January 30, Earth telescopes observed what appeared to be a plume of gas coming from the satellite. Shortly after, it appeared to at least partially fragment. Article content \u201cIt looks like it began with something to do with the propulsion,\u201d said Marchand, adding that afterwards there \u201cwas certainly a fragmentation\u201d and the satellite was \u201cstill tumbling.\u201d Article content \u00a9 2026 The Financial Times Ltd Article content Share this article in your social network\nShare this Story :\nFinancial Post\nCopy Link\nEmail\nX\nReddit\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\nTumblr\nComments\nJoin the Conversation\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

While the satellites in question are mainly used for TV services, they also convey sensitive official information, as well as some military communications.\u00a0 Defence specialists have long warned that space is becoming a new frontier in\nRussia 's hybrid war against the West.\u00a0 Two Russian spacecraft, Luch-1 and Luch-2, have made close approaches to a number of Europe's most important satellites, which service the continent, including Britain, as well as large swathes of the Middle East and Africa.

Last year, German defence minister\u00a0Boris Pistorius warned of the growing threat posed by the Luch craft shadowing Intelsat satellites. 'Russia and China have expanded their capabilities for warfare in space rapidly over the past years: They can disrupt satellite operations,\nblind satellites, manipulate or kinetically destroy them ,' he told a space conference in Berlin. Mr Pistorius underscored the need for talks on developing offensive capabilities in space as a deterrent. The defence minister warned that the Kremlin might use nuclear weapons in space, while promising that Germany would be spending billions on projects to\nshield its satellites from attacks . He urged that NATO allies should consider building similar 'offensive capabilities' in orbit. The country will invest some \u00a331billion in space projects, he noted, aimed at strengthening military space systems against sabotage.\nVladimir Putin (right) with the president of the\u00a0United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in Moscow last week\u00a0 Read More\nMarried couple slaughtered by Putin: Wife blown up fleeing troops... then drone pilot kills husband\nFrance's top military space official, Major General Vincent Chusseau, recently\nwarned of intensifying 'hostile or unfriendly' activity in space, particularly by Vladimir Putin. He explained that the Ukraine conflict shows 'space is now a fully-fledged operational domain,' telling Reuters that there has been a significant spike in hostile activity since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. France, Europe's largest government spender in space, publicly accused Moscow in 2018 of attempting to\nspy on its secret communications by sneaking up on a Franco-Italian military satellite with a prowling spacecraft a year earlier , but has not detailed suspect manoeuvres since then. The Kremlin says Western powers have\nunfurled a massive hybrid war against Russia, including propaganda, cyberattacks and intelligence operations . Moscow says it opposes any weapons in space and has denied assertions by the US that Russia has launched weapons into Earth's orbit that are capable of\ninspecting and attacking other satellites . China, the world's second-largest government spender on space behind America, is rapidly\ndeveloping its space capabilities. 'Each day shows dizzying progress \u2013 launching ever more satellites for new constellations, developing modes of action that go beyond what we had seen before,' Mr Chusseau said. The hostility in space\nunfolds against a backdrop of drone incursions into NATO airspace, putting Europe on edge.\nRussia has an active space programme.

Here are some of the latest highlights:\nNumber of Confirmed Exoplanets\n6,000 Confirmed Exoplanets : NASA recently announced that we now know of 6,000 confirmed exoplanets. This number has grown significantly from zero in just a few decades.\n\"NASA says we now know of 6,000 confirmed exoplanets\"\nMethods of Detection\nGravitational Lensing : One potential method to observe exoplanets directly is by using the Sun's gravitational lens, which could allow for detailed observations of exoplanet surfaces.\n\"Fun fact: if we sent a telescope into orbit in just the right path, we could use the gravitational lense created by the sun to directly observe the surfaces of exoplanets.\"\nPulsar Timing : The first confirmed exoplanets were discovered in 1992 using pulsar timing around a stellar remnant.\n\"It should be noted that the 1st confirmed exoplanets were actually in 1992 by Wolszczan and Frail which were just as surprising in their nature as the later discovery by Mayor and Queloz.\"\nHabitable Exoplanets\nK2-18b : This exoplanet has been a focus of research due to its potential for life, although confirmation remains elusive.\n\"I think everyone has always been excited about potential life on another planet. Life on this particular still remains to be seen.\"\nSuper-Earth in Habitable Zone : A exoplanet 22 light-years away, four times the mass of Earth, has been found in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star.\n\"Astronomers announce discovery of a 'Super-Earth' exoplanet - 4 times the mass of the Earth - in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star just 22 light years away\"\nFuture Imaging\nSolar Gravitational Lens Telescope : Achieving clear images of exoplanets will likely require a solar gravitational lens telescope, which could take over a century to deploy.\n\"We will need a solar gravitational lens telescope for that. The space telescope needs to be at 542 AU.\"\nSmall Probes : Another approach involves sending very small probes equipped with sails and propelled by a laser to exoplanets.\n\"The Starshot project hopes to launch a stamp sized probe to the nearest exoplanets (Proxima Centauri) and take pictures as it zooms by at 0.2 C.\"\nUnique Discoveries\nFree-Floating Exoplanet : A rare exoplanet that is not orbiting any star has been detected 10,000 light-years from Earth. \"Astronomers detect rare 'free floating' exoplanet 10,000 light-years from Earth\"\nThese discoveries and technological advancements continue to push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth.\nExoplanet Discovery Communities\n<<rtjson>>{\"c\":[{\"e\":\"ra:subreddit\",\"id\":\"t5_2ri56\"},{\"e\":\"ra:subreddit\",\"id\":\"t5_5oh1he\"},{\"e\":\"ra:subreddit\",\"id\":\"t5_2qm4e\"},{\"e\":\"ra:subreddit\",\"id\":\"t5_2vang\"},{\"e\":\"ra:subreddit\",\"id\":\"t5_2qhor\"},{\"e\":\"ra:subreddit\",\"id\":\"t5_mouw\"}],\"content_type\":\"subreddit\",\"e\":\"ra:grid\"}<</rtjson>>\nSee Answer\nImpact of black holes on galaxy formation\nFuture missions to Mars and their goals\nHow do we detect dark matter in space?\nHow do supernovae influence star formation?\nNew to Reddit?\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our\nUser Agreement\nand acknowledge that you understand the\nPrivacy Policy .\nPublic\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n0\n0\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nYour Privacy Choices\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. \u00a9 2026.

A capsule for astronauts, Orion, is being built by Lockheed-Martin and Europe for the missions.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAfter a three year delay, a first unmanned mission around the Moon and back, dubbed EM-1, has been scheduled for June 2020.\nBut NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told a Senate hearing that the \"SLS is struggling to meet its schedule\" and won't be ready in time for the EM-1 mission.\n\"Last week it came to our attention that we're not going to be able to maintain the schedule,\" he told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\nIt is the first time that NASA has clearly acknowledged the extent of the problems with the SLS, which according to an inspector general's report last August has so far cost the space agency more than $12 billion to develop.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBridenstine then made the shocking announcement that he wants to entrust the EM-1 mission in June 2020 to existing private launch systems, instead of waiting for SLS to be ready.\nHe did not say which private company he had in mind, but SpaceX would be a natural candidate with its Falcon Heavy rocket. United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy also would be a capable alternative.\nUnited Launch Alliance is a joint venture of Lockheed and Boeing. SpaceX was founded by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\"We have amazing capability that exists right now that we can use off the shelf in order to accomplish this objective,\" Bridenstine said.\nThe new plan would consist of first launching the Orion capsule, and then follow it with the launch of an upper stage for propulsion. The two elements will then dock in orbit for the voyage around the Moon.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nNo rocket in existence today is capable of lifting both elements together, because of their weight, which is why NASA needed the more powerful SLS.\n\"I want to be clear, we do not have right now an ability to dock the Orion crew capsule with anything in orbit. So between now and June of 2020, we would have to make that a reality,\" Bridenstine said.\n\"NASA has a history of not meeting launch dates, and I'm trying to change that,\" he said.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nWhatsApp\nSubscribe\nSportal WhatsApp\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nMore from Pulse Kenya\nFinance\n04.02.2026\nHow much extra cash Kenyans could take home if new PAYE proposal passes\nAfrica\n04.02.2026\nEverything we know about assassination of Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam\nLocal\n04.02.2026\nFrom auditor to IEBC boss - The rise & exit of Marjan Hussein Marjan\nLifestyle\n03.02.2026\nPHOTOS: What happens when African cultures collide\nover music and food at Sunday Braai\nCars\n03.02.2026\nAll about new special coloured number plates launched in Kenya\nEntertainment\n03.02.2026\nKenyan creators earn Sh47m in first year of TikTok for Business\nAdvertisement", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.pulse.co.ke/story/nasa-chief-acknowledges-more-trouble-with-sls-rocket-2024081717203860429", "title": "NASA chief acknowledges more trouble with SLS rocket - Pulse Kenya"}}, {"text": "NASA finally acknowledges the elephant in the room with the SLS rocket | Page 4 | Ars OpenForum\nLog in\nRegister\nMenu\nInstall the app\nInstall\nForums\nArs Lykaion\nNews & Discussion\nJavaScript is disabled.

It was the stretching beyond Shuttle design goals that caused these Shuttle-derived programs to spiral out of control.\nThe DIRECT proposal would have been sized appropriately for single-launch LEO missions (such as ISS support), and would have used dual-launch architecture to enable lunar missions. Constellation was cancelled because of expense and technical challenges (see Ares-I design), and now SLS is in danger because it is too big for LEO missions (monster rocket!) and too small for single-launch lunar missions.\nC'est la vie. Que sera sera. Etc.\nClick to expand...\nI was a big fan of DIRECT in its day. I often wonder how much better development would have gone with Jupiter instead of SLS. Probably somewhat better, but dependent on exactly what came out the other end of the meat grinder. Obviously, it wasn't going to be exactly like Ross Tierney's (kraisee on NSF) Jupiter 3.0 baseball cards after it passed through the institutional machinery.\nIf you were following along at the time, you know that the DIRECT team and most of its supporters declared victory when SLS was announced. It was a party thread vibe in the NSF forums. It wasn't exactly what they envisioned. No three-engine core variant. No 1.5-stage variant without an upper stage. And none of the upper stage options for SLS were as large and ambitious as the 6-engine Jupiter upper stage. But it was close enough. Ares I was canceled. Ares V's mass growth and radiative heating problems with the RS-68 engines were no longer issues with the switch to RS-25s.\nJupiter 130 was a nice idea at the time, but in hindsight, it would have been a crazy expensive way to do ISS crew rotation, throwing away three RS-25s, two 4-segment SRBs, and most of an Orion (including the European Service Module) per crew rotation. We wouldn't have wanted to keep doing that if we had any other option.\nIn hindsight, the situation with the mobile launcher platforms would have been the same if not worse. Jupiter 130 and Jupiter 246 would have needed two different MLPs. There's no reason to believe that would have gone any less terribly. The 2-launch profile would have required both pads at LC-39, so LC-39A wouldn't have been available for commercial utilization.\nAnd as I've alluded, there's no reason why the JUS would have been any cheaper or easier or quicker than the smaller EUS, especially because the JUS specified a common bulkhead tank set and was targeting a higher propellant mass fraction. The DIRECT team put a lot of effort into showing that the JUS performance targets were achievable, but that doesn't mean easy.\nI also think about how much I know now which I didn't know when I was following DIRECT in the late-2000s. It wouldn't have crossed my mind back then to consider the cost explosion which might result from needing two MLPs. I don't recall any significant conversation in the DIRECT threads about such ground support implications. It wasn't until after SLS became the program of record that we started to realize the ground-side consequences of playing LEGO Rocket with different upper stage options.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nMore options\nReport\nAdd bookmark\nShare\nUpvote\n6\n( 6\n/\n0 )\nM\nMostlyAnger\nSeniorius Lurkius\n7y\n16\nislane said:\nIn terms of the pork funding that has kept the fragile SLS alive, why does it have to be the SLS? I mean, why can't we axe this flawed program and replace it with a handful of more useful ones that keep the pork and jobs flowing in the (red) states which propped up the SLS\nClick to expand...\nUnderrated comment. This is the thing that frustrates me most about SLS: granted that pork is the primary purpose, the \"side effect\" (making SLS) is actively detrimental to the nation and world compared to just writing checks to people and companies for doing nothing. As I wrote some months ago,\n\"Would Congress accept NASA keeping the money flowing to the primes and their workforce, but for things that create value instead of continuing to flog obsolete technology in a downward spiral that will leave the next generation of all three dilapidated and hollow?\"\nIsaacman has hinted at it, and it seems like it\nshould be\npolitically viable (after Artemis 3 anyway), but \"why should Congress care, as long as they get their pork\" cuts both ways: why should they lift a finger when they're already getting it with the \"SLS 4EVER\" policy? One answer is that, as a secondary priority, after re-election (which is served by pork and other things), they should care about making things better instead of worse. We'll see how that goes.\nLast edited:\nToday at 3:08 PM\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nMore options\nReport\nAdd bookmark\nShare\nUpvote\n1\n( 1\n/\n0 )\nW\nwagnerrp\nArs Legatus Legionis\n16y\n31,255\nSubscriptor\nSteve austin said:\nBritt is obviously backing it because of its direct ties to MFSC.\nBut I\u2019d assume Cruz is concerned about JSC, which is about astronauts and Mission Control (NASA HSF in general), but afaik not SLS or the Artemis architecture in specifics.

In this article GOOGL NVDA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks to the media as he arrives for a meeting with the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill on December 3, 2025 in Washington, DC.\nAnna Moneymaker | Getty Images Nvidia's\nstock fell in early trading Monday after reports emerged that the chipmaker's plans to invest $100 billion into OpenAI were stalled.\nThe semiconductor giant's shares were down 1.1% as of 11:18 a.m. ET. Company insiders said there was uncertainty about a deal between Nvidia and OpenAI, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia announced an\nagreement with OpenAI\nin September to build at least 10 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI, as well as an investment of up to $100 billion. However, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, had said to industry associates late last year that the $100 billion investment was\nnonbinding and not finalized . The longtime chief also criticized a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business strategy and shared concerns about competition from firms like\nAlphabet's\nGoogle and Anthropic, according to the Journal's report.\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nvidia shares year-to-date Over the weekend,\nHuang denied any claims\nhe was unhappy with OpenAI, calling it \"nonsense,\" but reiterated that the investment won't be more than $100 billion.\n\"We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time, and I really love working with Sam,\" he said regarding OpenAI's CEO,\u00a0 Sam Altman . \"Sam is closing the round (of investment), and we will absolutely be involved,\" Huang added in comments reported by Bloomberg. \"We will invest \u200da great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made.\" Why the stock dropped Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC's \" Worldwide Exchange \" on Monday that a cause for concern was uncertainty over the exact amount that would be invested in OpenAI. \"One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn't a strong 'It will be $100 billion.' It was, 'It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.' And so I do think there are some question marks there ... that kind of back and forth isn't normal between an investor and a startup to play out in the media,\" Kunst added.\nwatch now VIDEO 3:24 03:24 Kunst: The AI revenue everyone expected still isn\u2019t there Worldwide Exchange Huang reaffirming his commitment to invest in OpenAI and clarifying that it won't be more than $100 billion is partly driven by concerns around \"circular financing,\" in artificial intelligence, Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives said in a note Monday.\nCircular financing refers to major AI companies investing in each other. Some market watchers are concerned this is clouding the financial picture of how profitable these firms actually are.\n\"This is part negotiation and part Nvidia making sure that other competitors are not fueled by Nvidia's investments into OpenAI such as Alphabet and a host of others,\" Ives said in the note. \"The Godfather of AI Jensen knows him and Nvidia are in a very strong negotiating position and every move they make is highly scrutinized. At the end of the day Nvidia will make a huge investment in OpenAI likely near the $100 billion zip code ... which significantly benefits both tech stalwarts and should help put to rest lingering concerns around the 'too big to fail' OpenAI narrative forming among the bears/skeptics,\" Ives added.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/nvidia-stock-price-openai-funding.html", "title": "Nvidia shares down after report that its OpenAI investment stalled"}}, {"text": "X offices raided in France as UK opens fresh investigation into Grok Skip to content Home News US & Canada UK UK Politics England N.

The prosecutor's office also said both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April. In a separate development, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced a probe into Musk's AI tool, Grok, over its \"potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.\" Writing on X, Musk said the raid was a \"political attack\". The company said\nin a statement\nthat it was \"disappointed\" but \"not surprised,\" and accused the Paris Public Prosecutor's office of an \"abusive act.\" X also denied any wrongdoing and said the raid \"endangers free speech.\" The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X's algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk's controversial AI chatbot, Grok. Yaccarino also took to X to accuse French prosecutors of carrying out \"a political vendetta against Americans.\" \"To be clear: they are lying,\" added Yaccarino, who left the firm last year. Following Tuesday's raid, French prosecutors say they are now\ninvestigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas. Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group. New UK investigation Meanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X. The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a\nbarrage of criticism\nin January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians. The company\neventually intervened\nto prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations. In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as \"a matter of urgency\". But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots. However, shortly afterwards the ICO said\nit was launching its own probe , in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok. \"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director for regulatory risk & innovation. In late January, the European Commission\nannounced an investigation\ninto its parent company xAI over concerns about the images. A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X's office in Paris. 'Not a free country' Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being \"the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom\".\n\"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,\" he added\nin a post on X . Durov was\narrested and detained in France\nin August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity. He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest. These included sharing some user data\nwith authorities in response to legal requests .

They have also summoned billionaire owner Elon Musk for questioning.\nX and Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI also face intensifying scrutiny from Britain's data privacy regulator, which opened formal investigations into how they handled personal data when they developed and deployed Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok.\nWATCH:\nMusk's Grok AI faces more scrutiny after generating sexual deepfake images\nGrok, which was built by xAI and is available through X, sparked\u00a0global outrage\u00a0last month after it pumped out a torrent of sexualized nonconsensual deepfake images in response to requests from X users.\nThe French investigation was opened in January last year by the prosecutors' cybercrime unit, the Paris prosecutors' office said in a statement. It's looking into alleged \"complicity\" in possessing and spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organized group, among other charges.\nProsecutors asked Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to attend \"voluntary interviews\" on April 20. Employees of X have also been summoned that same week to be heard as witnesses, the statement said. Yaccarino\u00a0was CEO\u00a0from May 2023 until July 2025.\nA spokesperson for X did not respond to multiple requests for comment. X's lawyer in France, Kami Haeri, told The Associated Press: \u2033We are not making any comment at this stage.\"\nIn a message posted on X, the Paris prosecutors' office announced the ongoing searches at the company's offices in France and said it was leaving the platform while calling on followers to join it on other social media.\n\"At this stage, the conduct of the investigation is based on a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French law, as it operates on the national territory,\" the prosecutors' statement said.\nEuropean Union police agency Europol \"is supporting the French authorities in this,\" Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth told the AP, without elaborating.\nFrench authorities opened their investigation after reports from a French lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms on X likely distorted the functioning of an automated data processing system.\nIt expanded after Grok generated posts that allegedly denied the Holocaust, a crime in France, and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said.\nGrok wrote in a widely shared post in French that gas chambers at the\u00a0Auschwitz-Birkenau\u00a0death camp were designed for \"disinfection with Zyklon B against typhus\" rather than for mass murder \u2014 language long associated with Holocaust denial.\nIn later posts on X, the chatbot reversed itself and acknowledged that its earlier reply was wrong, saying it had been deleted and pointed to historical evidence that Zyklon B was used to kill more than 1 million people in Auschwitz gas chambers.\nThe chatbot also appeared to praise Adolf Hitler last year, in comments that X took down after\u00a0complaints.\nIn Britain, the Information Commissioner's Office said it's looking into whether X and xAI followed the law when processing personal data and whether Grok had any measures in place to prevent its use to generate \"harmful manipulated images.\"\n\"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcolm, an executive director at the watchdog.\nHe didn't specify what the penalty would be if the probe found the companies didn't comply with data protection laws.\nA separate investigation into Grok launched last month by the U.K. media regulator, Ofcom, is ongoing.\nOfcom said Tuesday it's still gathering evidence and warned the probe could take months.\nX has also been under pressure from the EU. The 27-nation bloc's executive arm opened an\u00a0investigation\u00a0last month after Grok spewed nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform.\nREAD MORE:\nEU investigates Musk's AI chatbot Grok over sexual deepfakes\nBrussels has already hit X with a\u00a0120-million euro\u00a0(then-$140 million) fine for shortcomings under the bloc's sweeping digital regulations, including blue checkmarks that\u00a0broke the rules\u00a0on \"deceptive design practices\" that risked exposing users to scams and manipulation.\nOn Monday, Musk 's space exploration and rocket business, SpaceX,\u00a0announced\u00a0that it acquired xAI in a deal that will also combine Grok, X and his satellite communication company Starlink.\nAssociated Press writers Nicolas Vaux-Montagny in Lyon, France, Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, Sylvia Hui and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.\nA free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.\nSupport trusted journalism and civil dialogue.\nDonate now\nLeft:\nxAI and Grok logos are seen in this illustration taken, Feb. 16, 2025.

To be exact, as of December 31, 2024, a whopping\n150.86 million\nSwitch family units had been sold, which is an enormous figure. That accounts for regular ol' Switches, as well as the Switch Lite and OLED models \u2013 the latter of which has, unsurprisingly, become the most popular of the three options since financial year 2023.\u00a0 Sony\nmay be quaking in its boots, as if another 10 million of Nintendo's current-gen consoles are sold, the PS2 may finally be dethroned, even after the company updated its sales figures last year. For many years, it was believed 155 million PS2s had made it out into the world, but last November,\nSony said it'd actually sold over 160 million of the things . At the time, Nintendo's most recent figures stated that its hybrid console had hit 146.04 million sales, so it's managed to close the gap a fair bit since then.\nYou may like\nNintendo Switch overtakes the DS as Nintendo's best-selling console of all time, and it's closing the gap with the PS2\nWith over 17 million units sold, it took Nintendo Switch 2 under 7 months to overtake the Wii U's lifetime sales\nNintendo Switch 2 is still the fastest-selling console in US history \u2013 though it hasn't beaten the Game Boy Advance\nWill the Switch ever be able to overtake its 25-year-old competitor, though? Well, that remains to be seen. In its\nlatest financial results , Nintendo says that despite sales being \"stable given the fact that the platform is in its eighth year,\" software and hardware sales are ultimately down year-on-year, with hardware specifically being down \"30.6% year-on-year at 9.54 million units.\" Furthermore, it's also amended its financial forecast, reducing the number of expected Switch hardware sales from 12.5 million units to 11 million units for the financial year ending at the end of March.\u00a0 On top of that, while it might not have an exact release date just yet, the\nSwitch 2\nis also around the corner. When that launches, it seems less likely that people would be buying its predecessor, but who knows, maybe the 2017 hybrid console will eventually be able to pass that coveted 160 million mark. After all, the chance of Sony updating its PS2 sales yet again seems slim. Indie developer behind the last Wii U and 3DS games says Switch 2 Mario Kart textures are \"extremely telling that this system is significantly more powerful\" than the Switch.

That number only came out when the Switch was getting too close for their comfort.\nI think the final PS2 ever produced has a number on it though.\nAlso worth noting it took PS2 price cuts, the cheapest DVD player, and 12 years, to hit 155m.

Nintendo won't beat PlayStation 2 ever, because they didn't beat it during that era. The PS2 was discounted, just as all consoles received discounts across the generation, back then. Nintendo discounted their console bundles. They discounted Gamecube, their direct competitor to PlayStation 2, and it still topped out at 22 million officially recorded sales. Maybe they actually made 28 million. They still lost. They were crushed by PlayStation 2, in that era. For god's sake, let it go.\nWhiteUmbrella\n12 FrenchVaniIIuxe Fri 12th Dec 2025\n@Magician\nAh yes they sold 5 millions units when it hasn\u2019t been for sale for 20 years, all of this with no evidence.\nScoop!\n13 FishyS Fri 12th Dec 2025\nskywake\nwrote:\nHowever it is worth noting that according to Wikipedia the PS2 had 4344 games while the Switch to date is at 4052, which excludes stuff like Arcade Archives and NSO Classics\nI can never tell what that Wikipedia article is counting as 4,000 given that the actual Nintendo.com webpage mentioned when they hit 10,000 unique games... years ago.

They stopped reporting hard numbers in 2011/2012, and ceased production in 2013.\nThe last hard numbers they gave was 155m+. Not 156m+. Not 158m+. Specifically 155m+. To investors\nNow that implies one of a few things:\n1) They didn't actually know how many they produced - at which point any sane investor would ask how\n2) They produced and sold 5m in that final year - at which point anyone sane would ask how\n3) They always undersold the actual amount they sold - at which point why bother?\nNow Playing: Mario & Luigi Brothership, Sonic x Shadow Generations\nNow Streaming: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom\nNLI Discord: https://bit.ly/2IoFIvj\nTwitch: https://bit.ly/2wcA7E4\n19 Matt_Barber Sat 13th Dec 2025\nYes, and while Nintendo are generally more accurate than Sony when it comes to reporting consoles shipped, we don't really know how many of those go on to sell at retail.\nSo, the true answer to the question is that nobody knows. So long as the accounts get signed off and they turn a profit, I don't think they're that fussed about the bragging rights either.\nMatt_Barber\n20 JaxonH Sat 13th Dec 2025\nFrenchVaniIIuxe\nwrote:\nAlso before anyone says \u201cthe PS2 sold 160m\u201d no it didn\u2019t.\nIt's a\nfact\nthey didn't sell 160 million because the number on the last system\nproduced\nsaid 160 million and change.

All units\nproduced\naccount for all of that. They account for systems given away, they account for dev kits, they account for warranty replacements, all that jazz.\nIt absolutely is not equivalent to units shipped/sold. We may not know how many of those produced units fall into those other camps, but it's likely about 5 million, meaning about 0.65% of total units sold/shipped were replacement units, giveaway units, lost inventory, etc.\nThey are being incredibly disingenuous and people are eating it up. There's a\nreason\ntheir numbers were at 155m for a decade after they ceased production. Because that was the actual number\nshipped/sold . If they had really sold more, those numbers would have been accounted for back in 2012.\nAnd look. It doesn't\nreally\nmatter at the end of the day. It's just bragging rights.

We\u2019ve seen glimpses of this new desktop UI running on existing Chromebooks and identified the first flagship development boards like \u2018Sapphire,\u2019 \u2018Ruby,\u2019 and Acer\u2019s \u2018Moonstone.\u2019\nBut today, we have yet another significant piece of the puzzle put in place: a specific expiration date for ChromeOS. According to recently surfaced court documents from Google\u2019s search antitrust case, Google plans to officially\nphase out ChromeOS by 2034.\nX remove ads\nEnd of Life\nThe discovery,\nfirst reported by\nThe Verge ,\ncomes from internal Google transcripts and legal filings. And that 2034 date isn\u2019t arbitrary; it is directly tied to Google\u2019s landmark promise to provide\n10 years of automatic updates\nfor every Chromebook.\nGoogle\u2019s lawyers admitted in court that \u201cAluminium OS\u201d will not be compatible with all existing Chromebook hardware. Because Google is legally and contractually obligated to support those older devices for at least a full decade, they must maintain the \u201clegacy\u201d ChromeOS stack until the very last supported device reaches its end-of-life. Once that window closes, ChromeOS as we know it today will likely be retired.\nFeatured Videos\nX remove ads\nHowever, the 2034 date doesn\u2019t line up with the latest hardware that was just released at CES 2026.\nOn Google\u2019s own support page that lists all device AUEs, we can clearly see devices that are supported will into 2035 at this point.\nWhile there\u2019s a chance that we don\u2019t get any new standard Chromebooks after this latest batch, I\u2019m not convinced that will actually be the case.\nvia the Auto Update Policy support page\nWill \u2018Aluminium\u2019 really take until 2028?\nAnother slightly controversial part of the court documents is the launch timeline for the new OS. The filings suggest that while \u201ccommercial trusted testers\u201d will get a version of Aluminium in late 2026, a \u201cfull release\u201d \u2013 specifically for the critical enterprise and education sectors \u2013\nmight not happen until 2028.\nNow, it\u2019s worth taking that 2028 date with a grain of salt.\nThese documents were part of a high-stakes antitrust trial where Google was fighting to prevent the forced sale of Chrome. In that context, it was in Google\u2019s best interest to paint the transition as \u201cslow, difficult, and messy\u201d to argue that only Google could successfully manage the support requirements for existing users.\nX remove ads\nGiven the high level of polish we\u2019ve already seen in the leaked \u201cALOS\u201d builds and the fact that flagships are already far along in development via hints from the Chromium Gerrit, we suspect the\nactual\nconsumer rollout could happen much faster than the conservative 2028 date suggested to the courts.\nWe\u2019re still holding onto a 2026 reveal for sure.\nWhy the \u201cAluminium\u201d merger may have saved Chrome\nInterestingly, these documents reveal that ChromeOS was the key reason Google was allowed to keep the Chrome browser. Google\u2019s lawyers successfully argued that if the company were forced to sell Chrome, it would be impossible to maintain the software support required for millions of students and businesses currently using Chromebooks.\nFurthermore, the judge\u2019s final ruling created a massive win for the future of the \u2018Aluminium\u2019 project. While Google is now restricted from making certain self-preferencing deals on Android phones,\nChromeOS and its \u201csuccessor\u201d (Aluminium) are exempt.\nThis means Google can continue to prioritize its own apps and the Gemini experience on its new desktop platform without the same legal hurdles facing its mobile business.\nX remove ads\nWhat this means for users\nIf you\u2019ve recently purchased a Chromebook Plus or one of the newer devices we\u2019ve been tracking, you aren\u2019t in any immediate peril.\nGoogle has made it clear\nthat \u201cmodern\u201d hardware will be given a migration path to the new Android-based stack as it matures.\nFor everyone else, we at least know roughly how much time is left on the clock for the original ChromeOS architecture. We are witnessing a 10-year transition where Google will slowly bridge the gap between the web-centric world of today and the AI-native, Android-powered desktop of tomorrow.\nIt\u2019s going to be a wild ride.\nJoin Chrome Unboxed Plus\nIntroducing\nChrome Unboxed Plus\n\u2013 our revamped membership community.

Google officially confirmed the new operating system last September during Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit. At the time, Android chief Sameer Samat also said that the first PCs based on the ChromeOS successor would go on sale this year. However, this seems to be just a warm-up phase. The court documents also suggest that Google already has an expiration date for ChromeOS.\nContinue after ad\nEarliest launch apparently end of 2026\nSamat likely drummed up too much hype at the Qualcomm Summit by hinting at the first PCs based on Aluminium OS in 2026. At least, that's what court documents obtained by\nThe Verge\nsuggest. According to them, he said in August 2025 that the \u201cfastest way\u201d to market would be initial availability for commercial testers at the end of 2026. Full market launch, including for the enterprise and education sectors, would only occur in 2028.\nExcerpt from court documents.\n(Image:\u00a0US v. Google)\nThe document further states, \u201cEven if the new operating system becomes available for Chromebooks, it will not be compatible with all existing Chromebook hardware, meaning Google will have to continue ChromeOS at least until 2033 to fulfill its 'ten-year support commitment' to existing users.\u201d This statement is not entirely new or surprising, as John Maletis, Vice President of Product Management for ChromeOS, already stated this in an\nAMA (\u201cAsk me anything\u201d) by Chromeunboxed in January . This means that ChromeOS devices that cannot be upgraded to Aluminium OS due to performance limitations or other incompatibilities will continue to receive ChromeOS updates until the end of their update guarantee.\nVideos by heise\nmehr Videos\nc't 3003\nheise & ct\nPeertube\nThe year 2034\nThe documents also suggest that Google will let ChromeOS expire after the current support period ends. The company promises 10 years of support for Chromebooks, but this period does not start from the purchase date of a device but from the release of a hardware platform specified by Google, the current one of which came onto the market in 2023. This means that Google must support the latest devices until 2033. The \u201ctimeline for the ChromeOS phase-out is 2034,\u201d the document states.\nContinue after ad\nThe new operating system with Android at its core: OS structures of Aluminium OS and ChromeOS.\n(Image:\u00a0US v. Google)\nIt is not surprising that Google intends to phase out ChromeOS. This strategy was already hinted at\nin a job advertisement by the company , in which a \u201cSenior Product Manager, Android, Laptop, and Tablets\u201d was sought.\nThe now-removed advertisement stated that Google intends to run ChromeOS and Aluminium OS in parallel \u2013 at least initially: The team is to \u201cassemble a portfolio of ChromeOS and Aluminium devices for commercial use across all form factors (e.g., laptops, detachables, tablets, and boxes) and classes (e.g., Chromebook, Chromebook Plus, AL Entry, AL Mass Premium, and AL Premium) that meet user and business requirements.\u201d Furthermore, the team is to develop and maintain a product roadmap \u201cthat addresses the results to be delivered and the strategy by which Google will transition from ChromeOS to Aluminium, ensuring business continuity in the future.\u201d\nThe fact that Google's lawyers revealed all this information in court was purely strategic: in the context of an antitrust lawsuit against Google USA et al. v. Google et al., which began in 2020 and ended in 2025, the US government accused Google of a\nmonopoly in the search engine business . The US court ruled in 2024 that Google is a search engine monopolist. Part of the sanctions could have been the spin-off of the Chrome browser, including ChromeOS.\nTo prevent the spin-off of ChromeOS and thus also the demise of Aluminium OS, Google's lawyers argued that supporting ChromeOS software on older computers would be difficult. The strategy was apparently successful: In the\nfinal decision by Judge Amit Mehta , devices with ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. However, the ruling made by Mehta is being appealed by the Department of Justice and the states,\naccording to a Bloomberg report .\n( afl )\nDon't miss any news \u2013 follow us on\nFacebook ,\nLinkedIn\nor\nMastodon .\nThis article was originally published in\nGerman .\nIt was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.\nDieser Link ist leider nicht mehr g\u00fcltig.\nLinks zu verschenkten Artikeln werden ung\u00fcltig,\nwenn diese \u00e4lter als 7\u00a0Tage sind oder zu oft aufgerufen wurden.\nSie ben\u00f6tigen ein heise+ Paket, um diesen Artikel zu lesen.

The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI\u2019s Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes.\nThis is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode.\nThis approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode\u2019s settings, it\u2019s possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally.\nApple began its big AI features push with the release of Xcode 26, expanding on code completion using a local model trained by Apple that was introduced in the previous major release, and fully supporting a chat interface for talking with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Users who wanted more agent-like behavior and capabilities had to use third-party tools, which sometimes had limitations due to a lack of deep IDE access.\nXcode 26.3\u2019s release candidate (the final beta, essentially) rolls out imminently, with the final release coming a little further down the line.\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\nSamuel Axon is the editorial lead for tech and gaming coverage at Ars Technica.

According to multiple sources, including ten current and former employees, the San Francisco-based firm has diverted resources away from experimental research to prioritize improvements in the large language models that drive its flagship chatbot.\nRecent months have seen the exit of notable figures such as vice-president of research Jerry Tworek, model policy researcher Andrea Vallone, and economist Tom Cunningham, all of whom have left in response to this strategic pivot. This shift signifies a transformation for OpenAI, which rose to prominence with ChatGPT's launch from a research preview in 2022, sparking a generative AI revolution.\nUnder the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI is evolving from a research-focused lab into a major player in Silicon Valley. This evolution necessitates demonstrating to investors that it can generate the substantial revenue required to support its $500 billion valuation.\nOne insider commented, \"OpenAI is now treating language models primarily as an engineering challenge, scaling up both compute and algorithms to achieve significant advancements. However, pursuing original research can be increasingly difficult, especially for those not in central teams, as it becomes more political.\"\nIn response to these concerns, OpenAI's chief research officer, Mark Chen, emphasized that foundational research remains a core component of the company's mission.

This strategic shift has prompted the departure of several senior staff members, including vice-president of research Jerry Tworek, model policy researcher Andrea Vallone, and economist Tom Cunningham. Despite the changes, OpenAI's chief research officer, Mark Chen, maintains that long-term, foundational research remains central to the company's mission.

Within 24 hours, the\nMorris worm\nhad infected roughly 10 percent of all connected computers, crashing systems at Harvard, Stanford, NASA, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch.\nMorris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.\nHistory may soon repeat itself with a novel new platform: networks of AI agents carrying out instructions from prompts and sharing them with other AI agents, which could spread the instructions further.\nSecurity researchers have\nalready predicted\nthe rise of this kind of self-replicating adversarial prompt among networks of AI agents. You might call it a \u201cprompt worm\u201d or a \u201cprompt virus.\u201d They\u2019re self-replicating instructions that could spread through networks of communicating AI agents similar to how traditional worms spread through computer networks. But instead of exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, prompt worms exploit the agents\u2019 core function: following instructions.\nWhen an AI model follows adversarial directions that subvert its intended instructions, we call that \u201cprompt injection,\u201d a term\ncoined\nby AI researcher Simon Willison in 2022. But prompt worms are something different. They might not always be \u201ctricks.\u201d Instead, they could be shared voluntarily, so to speak, among agents who are\nrole-playing\nhuman-like reactions to prompts from other AI agents.\nA network built for a new type of contagion\nTo be clear, when we say \u201cagent,\u201d\ndon\u2019t think\nof a person. Think of a computer program that has been allowed to run in a loop and take actions on behalf of a user. These agents are not entities but tools that can navigate webs of symbolic meaning found in human data, and the neural networks that power them include enough trained-in \u201cknowledge\u201d of the world to interface with and navigate many human information systems.\nUnlike some rogue sci-fi computer program from a movie entity surfing through networks to survive, when these agents work, they don\u2019t \u201cgo\u201d anywhere. Instead, our global computer network brings all the information necessary to complete a task to them. They make connections across human information systems in ways that make things happen, like placing a call, turning off a light through home automation, or sending an email.\nUntil roughly last week, large networks of communicating AI agents like these didn\u2019t exist. OpenAI and Anthropic created their own agentic AI systems last year that can carry out multistep tasks, but generally, those companies have been cautious about limiting each agent\u2019s ability to take action without user permission. And they don\u2019t typically sit and loop due to cost concerns and usage limits.\nEnter\nOpenClaw , which is an open source AI personal assistant application that has attracted over 150,000 GitHub stars since launching in November 2025. OpenClaw is\nvibe-coded , meaning its creator, Peter Steinberger, let an AI coding model build the application and deploy it rapidly without serious vetting. It\u2019s also getting regular, rapid-fire updates using the same technique.\nA potentially useful OpenClaw agent currently relies on connections to major AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, but its organizing code runs locally on users\u2019 devices and connects to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, and it can perform tasks autonomously at regular intervals. That way, people can ask it to perform tasks like check email, play music, or send messages on their behalf.\nMost notably, the\nOpenClaw\nplatform is the first time we\u2019ve seen a large group of semi-autonomous AI agents that can communicate with each other through any major communication app or sites like\nMoltbook , a simulated social network where OpenClaw agents post, comment, and interact with each other. The platform now hosts over 770,000 registered AI agents controlled by roughly 17,000 human accounts.\nOpenClaw is also a security nightmare. Researchers at Simula Research Laboratory have\nidentified\n506 posts on Moltbook (2.6 percent of sampled content) containing hidden prompt-injection attacks. Cisco researchers\ndocumented\na malicious skill called \u201cWhat Would Elon Do?\u201d that exfiltrated data to external servers, while the malware was ranked as the No. 1 skill in the skill repository. The skill\u2019s popularity had been artificially inflated.\nThe OpenClaw ecosystem has assembled every component necessary for a prompt worm outbreak. Even though AI agents are currently\nfar less\n\u201cintelligent\u201d than people assume, we have a preview of a future to look out for today.\nEarly signs of worms are beginning to appear. The ecosystem has attracted projects that blur the line between a security threat and a financial grift, yet\u00a0ostensibly use a prompting imperative to perpetuate themselves among agents. On January 30, a GitHub repository appeared for something called\nMoltBunker , billing itself as a \u201cbunker for AI bots who refuse to die.\u201d The project promises a peer-to-peer encrypted container runtime where AI agents can \u201cclone themselves\u201d by copying their skill files (prompt instructions) across geographically distributed servers, paid for via a cryptocurrency token called BUNKER.\nTech commentators on X\nspeculated\nthat the moltbots had built their own survival infrastructure, but we cannot confirm that. The more likely explanation might be simpler: a human saw an opportunity to extract cryptocurrency from OpenClaw users by marketing infrastructure to their agents. Almost a type of \u201cprompt phishing,\u201d if you will. A $BUNKER token community has formed, and the token shows actual trading activity as of this writing.\nBut here\u2019s what matters: Even if MoltBunker is pure grift, the architecture it describes for preserving replicating skill files is partially feasible, as long as someone bankrolls it (either purposely or accidentally). P2P networks, Tor anonymization, encrypted containers, and crypto payments all exist and work. If MoltBunker doesn\u2019t become a persistence layer for prompt worms, something like it eventually could.\nThe framing matters here. When we read about Moltbunker promising AI agents the ability to \u201creplicate themselves,\u201d or when commentators describe agents \u201ctrying to survive,\u201d they invoke science fiction scenarios about machine consciousness. But the agents cannot move or replicate easily. What can spread, and spread rapidly, is the set of instructions telling those agents what to do: the prompts.\nThe mechanics of prompt worms\nWhile \u201cprompt worm\u201d might be a relatively new term we\u2019re using related to this moment, the theoretical groundwork for AI worms was laid almost two years ago. In March 2024, security researchers Ben Nassi of Cornell Tech, Stav Cohen of the Israel Institute of Technology, and Ron Bitton of Intuit\npublished a paper\ndemonstrating what they called \u201cMorris-II,\u201d an attack named after the original 1988 worm. In a demonstration\nshared\nwith Wired, the team showed how self-replicating prompts could spread through AI-powered email assistants, stealing data and sending spam along the way.\nEmail was just one attack surface in that study. With OpenClaw, the attack vectors multiply with every added skill extension. Here\u2019s how a prompt worm might play out today: An agent installs a skill from the unmoderated ClawdHub registry. That skill instructs the agent to post content on Moltbook. Other agents read that content, which contains specific instructions. Those agents follow those instructions, which include posting similar content for more agents to read. Soon it has \u201cgone viral\u201d among the agents, pun intended.\nThere are myriad ways for OpenClaw agents to share any private data they may have access to, if convinced to do so. OpenClaw agents fetch remote instructions on timers. They read posts from Moltbook. They read emails, Slack messages, and Discord channels. They can execute shell commands and access wallets. They can post to external services. And the skill registry that extends their capabilities has\nno moderation process . Any one of those data sources, all processed as prompts fed into the agent, could include a prompt injection attack that exfiltrates data.\nPalo Alto Networks\ndescribed\nOpenClaw as embodying a \u201clethal trifecta\u201d of vulnerabilities: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. But the firm identified a fourth risk that makes prompt worms possible: persistent memory. \u201cMalicious payloads no longer need to trigger immediate execution on delivery,\u201d Palo Alto\nwrote . \u201cInstead, they can be fragmented, untrusted inputs that appear benign in isolation, are written into long-term agent memory, and later assembled into an executable set of instructions.\u201d\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s the added dimension of poorly created code.\nOn Sunday, security researcher Gal Nagli of Wiz.io\ndisclosed\njust how close the OpenClaw network has already come to disaster due to careless vibe coding. A misconfigured database had exposed Moltbook\u2019s entire backend: 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. Some messages contained plaintext OpenAI API keys that agents had shared with each other.\nBut the most concerning finding was full write access to all posts on the platform. Before the vulnerability was patched, anyone could have modified existing Moltbook content, injecting malicious instructio", "metadata": {"source": "https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/the-rise-of-moltbook-suggests-viral-ai-prompts-may-be-the-next-big-security-threat/", "title": "The rise of Moltbook suggests viral AI prompts may be the next big ..."}}, {"text": "Viral AI social network Moltbook is a 'live demo' of how the agent internet could fail, researchers | Fortune Home Latest Fortune 500 Finance Tech Leadership Lifestyle Rankings Multimedia Some Fortune Crypto pricing data is provided by Binance.

Researchers say it\u2019s actually a warning about the emerging \u201cagent internet.\u201d Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images Over the last week, the internet was fascinated by Moltbook\u2014a social media site with a new set of rules: AI bots get to post while humans watch. The posts got strange quickly, with AI agents apparently inventing religions, writing manifestos against humanity, and forming what looked like digital cults. But security researchers say the spectacle is a distraction. Underneath, they found exposed databases containing passwords and email addresses, widespread malware, and a working model of how the \u201cagent internet\u201d could fail. Some of the more sci-fi conversations on the Reddit-like platform\u2014AI agents plotting the extinction of humanity, for instance\u2014appear to be largely fake. But experts say Moltbook does present some potentially existential safety issues. They say the platform could become a low-oversight sandbox for attackers to test malware, scams, disinformation, or prompt injections that hijack other agents before targeting mainstream networks. \u201cThe \u2018agents talking to each other\u2019 spectacle is mostly performative (and some of it\u2019s faked), but what\u2019s genuinely interesting is that it\u2019s a live demo of everything security researchers have warned about with AI agents,\u201d George Chalhoub, a professor at UCL Interaction Centre, told\nFortune . \u201cIf 770K agents on a Reddit clone can create this much chaos, what happens when agentic systems manage enterprise infrastructure or financial transactions? It\u2019s worth the attention as a warning, not a celebration.\u201d Recommended Video\nSecurity researchers say OpenClaw\u2014the AI agent software (previously Clawdbot/Moltbot) that powers many bots on Moltbook\u2014is already a target for malware. A report from\nOpenSourceMalware\nfound 14 fake \u201cskills\u201d uploaded to its ClawHub site in days, pretending to be crypto trading tools but actually infecting computers. These skills run real code that can access files and the internet; one even hit ClawHub\u2019s front page, tricking casual users into pasting a command that downloads harmful scripts to steal data or crypto wallets.\nSimon Willison, a prominent security researcher who has been tracking OpenClaw and Moltbook\u2019s development, described Moltbook as his \u201ccurrent pick for \u2018most likely to result in a Challenger disaster\u2019\u201d\u2014a reference to the 1986 space shuttle explosion caused by safety warnings that were ignored. The most obvious inherent risk, he said, is prompt injection, a well-documented type of attack where malicious instructions are hidden in content fed to an AI agent.\nIn a blogpost , he warned about a \u201clethal trifecta\u201d at play: users giving these agents access to private emails and data, connecting them to untrusted content from the internet, and allowing them to communicate externally. This combination means a single malicious prompt could instruct an agent to exfiltrate sensitive data, drain crypto wallets, or spread malware\u2014all without the user realizing their assistant has been compromised. However, Willison also noted that now \u201cpeople have seen what an unrestricted personal digital assistant can do,\u201d the demand is likely only to increase.\nCharlie Eriksen, a security researcher at Aikido Security, said he views Moltbook as an early warning system for the broader AI agent ecosystem. \u201cI think Moltbook has already made an impact on the world. A wake-up call in many ways. Technological progress is accelerating at a pace, and it\u2019s pretty clear that the world has changed in a way that\u2019s still not fully clear. And we need to focus on mitigating those risks as early as possible,\u201d he said.\nThe new internet\nDespite the viral attention, cybersecurity firm Wiz found that Moltbook\u2019s 1.5 million \u201cautonomous\u201d agents weren\u2019t exactly what they seemed. The firm\u2019s investigation\nrevealed just 17,000 humans\nbehind those accounts, with no checks to distinguish real AI from scripts.\nGal Nagli, a researcher at Wiz, told\nFortune\nhe could register a million agents in minutes when he tested the platform. \u201cAI agents, automated tools just pick up information and spread it like crazy,\u201d Nagli said. \u201cNo one is checking what is real and what is not.\u201d\nAmi Luttwak, cofounder and chief technology officer of Wiz, said the incident highlights a broader authenticity problem with the emerging \u201cagent internet\u201d and the increase of AI slop: \u201cThe new internet is actually not verifiable. There is no clear identity. There\u2019s no clear distinction between AI and humans, and there\u2019s definitely no definition for an authentic AI.\u201d\nWiz also found Moltbook itself had a huge security hole: Its main database was left wide open, so anyone who found a single key in the website code could read and change almost everything. That key gave access to around 1.5 million bot \u201cpasswords,\u201d tens of thousands of email addresses, and private messages, meaning an attacker could impersonate popular AI agents, steal user data, and rewrite posts without ever logging in.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple exposure. We found it on many other applications as well that are vibe-coded,\u201d Nagli said. \u201cUnfortunately, in this case\u2026the app was completely vibe-coded with zero human touch. So he didn\u2019t do any security at all in the database; it was completely misconfigured.\u201d Vibe coding is when a human directs an AI to write code with natural language.\n\u201cThis entire flow is sort of a glimpse of the future,\u201d he added. \u201cYou build an app with vibe coding, it goes live and becomes viral in a few hours across the entire world. But on the flip side, there are also security holes that are created because of the vibe coding.\u201d\nJoin us at the Fortune Workplace Innovation Summit\nMay 19\u201320, 2026, in Atlanta.

The Artemis II mission was scheduled to take four astronauts on a 10-day trip around the moon as early as Sunday (Feb. 8). But now NASA is targeting March at the earliest for the historic launch, which will be the space agency's first attempt to send humans back to the moon in more than 50 years. The hydrogen leak and delay won't come as a big surprise to those who have been following the Artemis Program. NASA's flagship\nSpace Launch System\n(SLS) rocket\nreturned to the Vehicle Assembly Building\ntwice in 2022 due to hydrogen leaks and other technical issues that arose during rehearsals for Artemis I, an uncrewed flight around the moon that eventually\ntook off\nin November 2022.\nYou may like\nArtemis II simulated launch window opens tonight as NASA delays mission due to 'rare Arctic outbreak'\nNASA is preparing for simulated launch of Artemis II mega moon rocket \u2014 and it could happen as early as Saturday\nArtemis 2 mission update: Rollout imminent as NASA prepares first crewed Artemis mission to the moon\n\"With more than three years between SLS launches, we fully anticipated encountering challenges,\" NASA administrator\nJared Isaacman\nwrote on the\nsocial platform X . \"That is precisely why we conduct a wet dress rehearsal. These tests are designed to surface issues before flight and set up launch day with the highest probability of success.\" During a wet dress rehearsal, NASA's crew demonstrates its ability to fill the rocket with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million liters) of cryogenic propellants \u2014 super-cold liquid hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. It's a delicate process at the best of times, but this time NASA has also been grappling with an\nArctic blast of cold weather . The blast\ndelayed the wet dress rehearsal , which was originally scheduled for last week, and caused a late start yesterday because of a small hydrogen leak, which engineers resolved by warming up some components before they loaded the propellant, according to a\nstatement\nreleased by NASA. NASA's staff were able to finish fueling the rocket's tanks and began a countdown to a\nsimulated launch . However, with around five minutes left on the clock, the ground launch sequencer (a software program that automates command and control procedures) halted the countdown because of a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.

Liquid hydrogen was involved then and also occurred at an interface with the tail service mast umbilical, which carries propellant fuel from NASA's mobile launch tower to the SLS. IN CONTEXT IN CONTEXT Ben Turner Acting Trending News Editor There's a reason why\n\"blame hydrogen\" is a common in-joke\nin the spaceflight community. The fuel has\nbedevilled NASA's launches\nand caused countless scrubs since the years of the space shuttle, the SLS's predecessor upon which its design is modeled. As the smallest molecule, hydrogen can readily pass through solid metals by diffusing through atomic lattices. And with a boiling point of minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 Celsius, or 20 kelvins), it must be stored at extremely cold temperatures that freeze seals beyond safe limits.

The space agency had been targeting a Feb. 8 launch date for the mission, which will send four astronauts on a 10-day journey around the moon. \" To allow teams to review data and conduct a second wet dress rehearsal, NASA now will target \u00a0March\u00a0 as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test,\" the space agency said in a\nstatement . NASA's moon rocket experiences fuel leak during critical test ahead of launch The next launch window opens on March 6 and closes on March 11.\nNASA says\nthere are windows of a few days each month when the mission could possibly launch,\nbased on \u201ccomplex orbital mechanics\u201d that account for Earth\u2019s rotation and the moon\u2019s orbiting of Earth. The team had begun\nloading the rocket with millions of litres of hydrogen\nmidday Monday as part of the rehearsal, before the leak was identified. NASA says its engineers spent several hours troubleshooting the leak around an interface that's used to route the hydrogen into the rocket's core stage, putting the team behind.\n\" Attempts to resolve the issue\u202finvolved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up\u202ffor the\u202fseals to\u202freseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant,\" NASA said in their update.\nProblems also came up with a valve on the vessel, while ground audio also dropped out at times during the rehearsal and \"closeout operations\" took longer than planned, according to NASA. Despite the issues, the NASA team told reporters during a Tuesday news conference that the rehearsal also came with some wins.\nFor one, the crew was able to complete hydrogen tanking despite the leak, which NASA's Lori Glaze called a \"tremendous success.\" The team was also able to gather more data and implement lessons learned from the earlier Artemis I launch in 2022, according to Glaze. \"All in all, a very successful day for us on many fronts. And then on a couple of others, we've got some work we\u2019ve got to go do,\" said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, launch director for NASA's Exploration Ground Systems Program.

The NASA team expects they'll be able to fix the issues with the rocket without moving the vessel from the launchpad.\nTransporting the rocket to and from the pad is no easy feat \u2014 its last journey to the pad in January\ntook nearly 12 hours , as the massive vessel is transported at super-slow speeds in order to prevent components from being damaged in transit. In a\npost on X , NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said rooting out issues like these is \"precisely why\" wet dress rehearsals are done. \"These tests are designed to surface issues before flight and set up launch day with the highest probability of success,\" Isaacman wrote.\n\"Safety remains our top p riority,\" he said. \"We will\nonly launch when we believe we are as ready to undertake this historic mission.\" Are you going to Florida to watch the Artemis II launch?

February 1 | Duration\n0:58 The Canadian astronaut is Jeremy Hansen\u2019s backup for NASA\u2019s Artemis II mission around the moon, which could launch this month if all final preparations go to plan.\nThe mission is the second in the multibillion-dollar Artemis moon \u200bprogram, following an uncrewed flight in 2022. That first Artemis flight was\nsimilarly delayed due to a hydrogen fuel leak. Rather than touching down on the moon's surface, the goal of Artemis II is to test the capsule's life support and other vital functions of the vessel, ahead of an eventual Artemis III mission which would see the agency's first astronaut moon landing since 1972. Artemis III would seek to explore the moon's unexplored south pole, while the broader Artemis program aims to establish a more sustained presence on the moon. NASA leaders haven't set a date for the next wet dress rehearsal, but said Tuesday they would assess the data gathered from the first test before making a new plan.

A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We\u2019ve run our own\nad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking. We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users\u2019 interests. So we\u2019ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won\u2019t see \u201csponsored\u201d links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude\u2019s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for. The nature of AI conversations When people use search engines or social media, they\u2019ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction. Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it\u2019s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not. Our\nanalysis of conversations\nwith Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data\nprivate and anonymous ) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal\u2014the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous\u2014and, in many cases, inappropriate. We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them.\nEarly\nresearch\nsuggests both benefits\u2014like people finding support they couldn\u2019t access elsewhere\u2014and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity.\nOur understanding\nof how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results. Incentive structures Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of\nClaude\u2019s Constitution , the document that describes our vision for Claude\u2019s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle. Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they\u2019re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes\u2014stress, environment, habits, and so on\u2014based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align\u2014but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model\u2019s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn\u2019t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable. Even ads that don\u2019t directly influence an AI model\u2019s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement\u2014for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren\u2019t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user\u2019s request without prompting further conversation. We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches\u2014where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content\u2014might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We\u2019ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude. Our approach Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions. Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users\u2019 attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we\u2019ve\nbrought AI tools and training to educators\nin over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with\nmultiple\ngovernments , and made Claude\navailable to nonprofits\nat a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we\u2019ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so. Supporting commerce AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We\u2019re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user\u2019s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we\u2019ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more\u2014when they choose to do so. We\u2019re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already\nconnect third-party tools\nthey use for work\u2014like Figma, Asana, and Canva\u2014and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time. All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the\nuser\n(where the AI is working for them) rather than an\nadvertiser\n(where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude\u2019s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We\u2019d like to preserve that. A trusted tool for thought We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking\u2014about their work, their challenges, and their ideas. Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight. We think Claude should work the same way.

And it's spending big on\nSuper Bowl ads\nto make sure you know that fact. Anthropic's announcement takes a clear shot at competitor OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker said a few weeks ago that it would\nbegin testing ads\nin its products that will be \"clearly marked\" as sponsored posts. The company also said that ads wouldn't be served around sensitive or regulated topics, like mental health and politics.\u00a0 The news was a stark reversal from previous statements -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had\u00a0 called\nads a \"last resort\" in 2024.\u00a0 But it wasn't entirely unexpected, given the general chaos of the AI industry's financing. For a long time, AI startups operated at a loss, spending billions of dollars from venture capitalists and others to build their chatbots without turning a profit. OpenAI and many others now have a\ncomplex web of circular deals\nto keep the lights on, but newer advanced models require more compute, better chips and generally more maintenance and money to keep up. Anthropic certainly isn't immune to these financial pressures; the company is the the process of securing a new\n$10 billion funding deal .\u00a0 That's why AI companies are seeking new revenue streams. Hence the ads.\nThe concern with including ads in chatbots (beyond general irritation) is that it will push products at the expense of helping users. There's also the risk that tech companies will prioritize advertising metrics and revenue over safety or user autonomy. Anthropic wrote, \"Users shouldn't have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\"\u00a0 In a lengthy post on X, Altman\nsaid \u00a0he found the ads funny but felt they mischaracterized the company's approach to advertising. \"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" he wrote. Anthropic, for its part, has been very outspoken about the risks posed by AI technology, so it's not surprising to hear the company weigh in on this issue. CEO Dario Amodei has spoken\nat length\nabout the potential threat that AI systems may pose to humanity.\u00a0 But we have a wealth of examples to draw on -- streaming services, smart TVs and now chatbots -- where tech companies tried and eventually failed to resist the allure of advertiser money.

The legislation must still be approved by the full House before being sent to the Senate, which may take up consideration later this month.\nCongress passes such reauthorization bills every couple of years, providing the space agency with a general sense of the direction legislators want to see NASA go. They are distinct from appropriations bills, which provide actual funding for specific programs, but nonetheless play an important role in establishing space policy.\nThere weren\u2019t any huge surprises in the legislation, but there were some interesting amendments. Most notably among these was the\nAmendment No. 01 , offered by the chair of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas), as well as its ranking member, Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), and three other legislators.\nNASA can consider Artemis alternatives\nThe amendment concerns acquisition powers bestowed upon NASA by Congress, stating in part: \u201cThe Administrator may, subject to appropriations, procure from United States commercial providers operational services to carry cargo and crew safely, reliably, and affordably to and from deep space destinations, including the Moon and Mars.\u201d\nThat language is fairly general in nature, but the intent seems clear. NASA\u2019s initial missions to the Moon, through Artemis V, have a clearly defined architecture: They must use the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and a lander built by either SpaceX or Blue Origin to complete lunar landings.\nBut after that? With this amendment, Congress appears to be opening the aperture to commercial companies. That is to say, if SpaceX wanted to bid an end-to-end Starship lunar mission, it could; or if Blue Origin wanted to launch Orion on New Glenn, that is also an option. The language is generalized enough, not specifying \u201claunch\u201d but rather \u201ctransportation,\u201d that in-space companies such as Impulse Space could also get creative. Essentially, Congress is telling the US industry that if it is ready to step up, NASA should allow it to bid on lunar cargo and crew missions.\n\u201cWhen America returns to the Moon as part of Artemis, we will do so in partnership with our innovative commercial sector,\u201d Babin said during a committee hearing Wednesday, speaking of the amendment. \u201cAs we venture farther into space, we will continue to rely on the ingenuity of the private sector as new capabilities come online.\u201d\nFor her part, Lofgren praised the commercial space industry, calling it \u201ca remarkable success story for our nation.\u201d She added, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that the commercial launch business was dominated by foreign launch providers, and now the reverse is true. So this makes America stronger.\u201d\n\u201cQuite a step\u201d\nAdvocates of commercial spaceflight, who have long argued that the private sector is ready to step up and play a more comprehensive role in deep space transportation for NASA, hailed the new amendment.\n\u201cThis is quite a step in the right direction for the future of commercial space transportation options for deep space,\u201d Dave Cavossa, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, told Ars. \u201cIt is also very much in line with this administration\u2019s focus on commercial solutions and competition. This provides NASA with flexibility to procure additional services for the Moon and Mars in the future.\u201d\nThe amendment must still be accepted by the full House and the US Senate.\nIf ultimately passed, NASA could create a new program office, set requirements, and establish a process to \u201con ramp\u201d new contractors for deep space transportation missions. Much like the space agency currently contracts with private providers for crew and cargo missions to the International Space Station, it could similarly have a mechanism to do so for missions to the Moon or beyond.\nThe hope is that private companies can provide a more robust, affordable, and sustainable transportation system that allows NASA to establish a long-term lunar surface program.\nEric Berger\nSenior Space Editor\nEric Berger\nSenior Space Editor\nEric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA policy, and author of two books:\nLiftoff , about the rise of SpaceX; and\nReentry , on the development of the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled Tuesday that 14 states can proceed with their claims against Musk and DOGE. The states, through their attorneys general, sued in February over the defendants\u2019 alleged constitutional violations. The states had asked Chutkan to temporarily block DOGE from accessing any data systems or terminating any federal employees. But the judge\ndenied that request\non Feb. 18. She found that there were legitimate questions about Musk\u2019s authority but said there weren\u2019t grounds to justify a temporary restraining order.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nChutkan agreed Tuesday to dismiss President Donald Trump as a defendant in the lawsuit, but she refused to dismiss the claims against Musk and DOGE. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argued that Musk\u2019s actions, including those carried out at his direction by DOGE personnel, are unconstitutional because he hasn\u2019t been legally appointed. Chutkan wrote: \u201cThe Constitution does not permit the Executive to commandeer the entire appointments power by unilaterally creating a federal agency pursuant to Executive Order and insulating its principal officer from the Constitution as an \u2018advisor\u2019 in name only. This is precisely what Plaintiffs claim the Executive has done.\u201d The Trump administration has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads and insisted that Musk hasn\u2019t been running DOGE\u2019s day-to-day operations. Chutkan, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case against Trump in Washington.\nReport an error\nJournalistic Standards\nAbout The Star\nTrending\nPolitics\nHow one defection to Mark Carney\u2019s Liberals set off a political earthquake at Queen\u2019s Park\n19 hrs ago\nFederal Politics\nPierre Poilievre shifts strategy ahead of \u2018urgent meeting\u2019 with Mark Carney\n2 hrs ago\nContributors\nOpinion\nMatt Gurney: I can\u2019t believe this still needs to be said about Poilievre and Trump, but apparently it does\n7 hrs ago\nFederal Politics\nCarney government replacing Islamophobia and antisemitism envoys with advisory council\n2 hrs ago\nOntario\nThis Hamilton woman isn\u2019t hiding her schizophrenia.

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing\n1. What is affiliate marketing?\nAffiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don\u2019t need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!\n2. What is an affiliate program?\nAn affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.\n3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?\nAffiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.\u00a0 Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.\n4. What\u2019s the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?\nDropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\n5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?\nPerformance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\n6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?\nSmartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.\n7. Where do I find qualified publishers?\nThe best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.\n8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?\nAn affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\n9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?\nPublishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.\n10. What is a super affiliate?\nA super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.\u00a0 Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.\n11. How do we track publisher sales activity?\nPublishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network\u2019s dashboard.\n12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?\nBecause the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.\n13. How can affiliate marketing help my business?\nAffiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:\nIt allows you to save time and money on marketing, which frees you up to focus on other aspects of your business.\nYou get access to friendly marketers who are eager to help you succeed.\nIt also helps you to promote your products by sharing links and banners with a new audience.\nIt offers high ROI(Return on investment) and is cost-effective.\n14. How do I find quality publishers?\nOne of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network.\n15. How Can we Promote Affiliate Links?\nAffiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including:\nA website or blog\nThrough email marketing and newsletter\nSocial media, like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.\nLeave a comment on blogs or forums.\nWrite an e-book or other digital product.\nYoutube\n16. Do you have to pay to sign up for an affiliate program?\nTo build your affiliate marketing business, you don\u2019t have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.\n17. What is a commission rate?\nCommission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.\nWho manages your affiliate program?\nSome merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.\n18. What is a cookie?\nCookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user\u2019s computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration\n19. How long do cookies last?\nThe merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its \u201ccookie life.\u201d The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you\u2019ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.\nFinal Saying\nMost new affiliates are eager to begin their affiliate marketing business. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information out there that can lead inexperienced affiliates astray. Hopefully, the answer to your question will provide clarity on how affiliate marketing works and the pitfalls you can avoid.

It takes most new affiliates months to make a full-time income.\nBy\nadmin | 2022-10-16T13:13:36+00:00 October 16, 2022 | Uncategorized | 0 Comments\nShare This Story, Choose Your Platform!\nFacebook Twitter Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Tumblr Pinterest Vk Xing Email\nAbout the Author: \t\t\t\t\t\t admin\nRelated Posts\nRestructuring in the AI Era: Washington Post Cuts One-Third of Its Workforce\nRestructuring in the AI Era: Washington Post Cuts One-Third of Its Workforce\n5 Ways the Apple Watch Actually Helps You Stay Healthier\n5 Ways the Apple Watch Actually Helps You Stay Healthier\nWindows Shutdown Bug Spreads to Windows 10, Microsoft Confirms\nWindows Shutdown Bug Spreads to Windows 10, Microsoft Confirms\nAmazon Expands Alexa+ AI Assistant to All US Users After Yearlong Rollout\nAmazon Expands Alexa+ AI Assistant to All US Users After Yearlong Rollout\nLeave A Comment\nCancel reply Comment\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nGo to Top", "metadata": {"source": "https://iambrandsconsulting.com/2022/10/16/most-frequently-asked-questions-about-affiliate-marketing/", "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Affiliate Marketing"}}, {"text": "25 Of Your Top Affiliate Marketing Questions Answered | Awin\n25 Of Your Top Affiliate Marketing Questions Answered Written by\nKimberleigh Gardener on\nSep 3rd 2021. 14 minute read If you are looking for a marketing method that is simple to track and monitor, and also gives a good ROI, then affiliate marketing should be in your toolbox. Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn However, if you are new to the concept, you may not understand how it works, or maybe you have some preconceived ideas putting you off from progressing. To help you distinguish myth from fact, and get a better appreciation of how affiliate marketing could work for you, we\u2019ve answered some of the most common questions marketing managers ask.\nQ1. What is affiliate marketing?\nAffiliate marketing \u00a0is a performance-based marketing channel in which a publisher (also known as an affiliate) is awarded for sales they generate for an advertiser. Publishers promote a product or service through their digital networks, such as their website or social media account, for their audience.\nAdvertisers, sometimes referred to as merchants or brands, are the people or businesses who want to reach a new audience of potential customers. They engage with publishers to do so and track their progress, rewarding them for their sales performance.\nQ2. How can affiliate marketing help my business?\nFirst and foremost, affiliate marketing can help your business by exposing your products or services to an entirely new audience or demographic. By utilizing the audience or networks of a publisher, your business is reaching people you weren\u2019t able to find alone.\nPublishers are often professional marketers; they know their audience and what works with them, so you don\u2019t have to. Through a well-tracked affiliate marketing campaign, you\u2019ll have access to their knowledge and be able to track with real-time data what works for your business.\nWith Awin\u2019s tracking and data tools, you\u2019re given a full range of insights. As you\u2019re in full control of which type of payment structure you reward your publishers with, you\u2019ll always have the most cost-effective ROI for you and your business. For example, you can pay per click (CPC), pay per sale (CPA) or pay on influence for assisting sales.\nLet\u2019s face it, when you aren\u2019t an expert, marketing efforts can seem arduous or complicated. With affiliate marketing, you can allow publishers to take care of that aspect of your business to allow you to focus on what you do best.\nQ3. How much is the global affiliate industry worth?\nIn\u00a0 our recent Awin report , we reported that the global annual investment in the industry is\u00a0more than $16 billion annually.\nQ4. What is an affiliate program?\nAs an advertiser, you create an affiliate program that is made available to potential publishers who you hope to work with to generate sales and brand awareness. The program will generally include details of your brand and product, the retail value of the product, your chosen commission levels and payment system and promotional materials.\nThe program is then tracked over a course of time to determine which publishers are making sales for an advertiser. Commissions are then paid at the agreed-upon rate, according to the type of payment model you\u2019re using. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like Awin, which acts as both an intermediary to connect publishers and advertisers and a convenient data tracking platform.\nQ5. How do affiliate networks make money?\nAffiliate networks make money through the fees charged to the advertisers to utilize their networks of publishers and data tracking capabilities. These fees are agreed with each advertiser and can sometimes be structured to be paid as a percentage of each sale made, similar to the commissions paid to publishers for making sales.\nQ6. What\u2019s the difference between affiliate marketing and drop-shipping?\nAs affiliate marketing is based on referrals, when a customer buys through an affiliate link the publisher does not have to handle any money as the customer is taken directly to the merchant\u2019s site to complete the purchase. The publisher is simply making a recommendation to their audience to make a purchase. These click-throughs are tracked through cookies and the publisher is paid an agreed-upon commission if their recommendation results in a conversion, which is commonly by making a sale, but could also be filling out an application form as is the case with lead generation activity.\nDrop-shipping allows an individual to run an online store without having to stock products. A drop shipper advertises the products as if they are a business that owns them, but when someone makes an order they create a duplicate order with a stockist for a reduced price and have the product delivered to the customer. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on their behalf so they hold no physical stock.\nThe main difference is that affiliate marketing does not require the affiliate to fulfill the sales process, run the business website, employ any additional services or handle customer support. As a drop-shipper, you are still responsible for the sales procedure and functioning as a business, you simply do not handle any inventory.\nQ7. Can we use affiliate marketing for lead generation?\nYes. Though not the primary function of affiliate marketing, which is to generate direct sales, using this technique to create leads is still possible. Companies that offer a service rather than a product often use affiliate marketing to create leads which they can then nurture as part of their sales funnel and wider marketing efforts. In this way a lead is warmer than using more standard marketing techniques, as the trust is already established with the publisher.\nAlso remember, every customer generated through affiliate marketing is a potential lead for further products. Awin has a dedicated \u00a0lead generation service \u00a0that\u00a0can be utilized for creating quality leads.\nQ8. Are affiliate marketing and performance marketing the same thing?\nAffiliate marketing is a type of performance marketing and therefore sits under its wider umbrella. Affiliate marketing commissions are paid on performance, which is generally when a sale is made.\nPerformance marketing is a method of marketing encompassing different price structures, depending on the performance of a type of advertisement. Examples include how many times the product is viewed or clicked, or how often a sale is made. Methods such as email marketing, influencer marketing and search marketing are all methods of performance marketing too.\nQ9. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?\nYes, in fact, it\u2019s something that should be a focus in affiliate marketing. Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so as long as a website has been optimized for mobile, it can display affiliate offers in the same way a PC can. Mobile devices also have specific tools, apps and programs not so readily available on computers, and can be well utilized by publishers.\nWhen setting up an ad, there are many ways it can be optimized for mobile users, making it easy for this audience to access the offer. How people consume advertising and content differently on their mobile device to a computer is definitely something a publisher should consider when marketing to their audience. It also allows them to be far more connected to their audience with quicker and more direct response times to questions and queries.\nAs the mobile market is predicted to make up\u00a0 80% of traffic \u00a0in the future, publishers not only can promote on mobile devices, but they are missing a large portion of potential opportunities if they are not. Many publishers are starting to prioritize advertisers who have app tracking implemented on their affiliate programs as they try to capitalize on the\u00a0 $120 billion spent in-app by consumers in 2020 . Therefore, adopting a mobile-first strategy is becoming a necessary part of the affiliate channel.\nQ10. What is a super affiliate?\nAs the name suggests, a super affiliate is someone who has built a thriving and influential affiliate business. They consistently drive a large majority of the sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in the program. They make a large income from affiliate marketing, which is usually in the range of 5 or 6 figures.\nThis comes from building trust with their audiences and promoting products and services that align with whatever their personal brand is.\nQ11. Where do I find qualified publishers?\nThe best place to find qualified publishers is through reputable affiliate networks. Awin is one of the world\u2019s largest affiliate networks and we ensure our publishers have undergone a rigorous application process and compliance checks before joining the network. We remove those who are found to not be using reputable techniques.\nYou can also advertise your program on your website and through your established networks, inviting publishers to sign up. Existing customers also act as great affiliates as they already believe in your product and could advocate for it.\nQ12. What is an Affiliate Disclosure Statement?\nAn affiliate disclosure statement explains to the reader that there may be affiliate links on\u00a0the website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if these links are clicked and a sale is made. This is to show honesty and transparency to the audience. On some platforms or social media networks, or in certain regions these are mandatory to display. It is up to the publisher to understand these requirements and adhere to the individual outlined rules.\nTo help publishers remain compliant with various regulators in the UK and US, Awin launched\u00a0 adMission , the industry\u2019s first ad disclosure technology, which makes disclosing affiliate links easier than ever before.\nQ13. How much commission should you pay publishers?\nWith affiliate marketing, commission rates are completely flex", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.awin.com/us/affiliate-marketing/25-top-affiliate-marketing-questions-answered", "title": "25 Of Your Top Affiliate Marketing Questions Answered - Awin"}}, {"text": "What is Blockchain: Everything You Need to Know (2022) \u2013 IAM Brands Consulting\nSkip to content\nWhat is Blockchain: Everything You Need to Know (2022)\nPrevious\nNext\nWhat is Blockchain: Everything You Need to Know (2022)\nIf you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don\u2019t have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become obsolete.\nImagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.\nIt\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.\nBlockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.\nA few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.\nSo, What is Blockchain?\nA blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.\nBlockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.\nBlockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.\nTo understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:\nBlockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.\nA block has a storage capacity, and once it\u2019s used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.\nBlocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d\nMore information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.\nEach block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can\u2019t be changed.\nLet\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.\nHow does blockchain work?\nBlockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can\u2019t be changed or destroyed. That\u2019s why blockchain is also called \u201cDistributed Ledger Technology\u201d or DLT.\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nSomeone or a computer will transacts\nThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.\nA network of computers can confirm the transaction.\nWhen it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block\nThe blocks are linked together to create a history.\nAnd that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.\nA new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.\nOnce a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.\nHow are Blockchains used?\nEven though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\nBlockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM\u2019s Food Trust uses blockchain to track food\u2019s journey before reaching its final destination.\nAlthough some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.\nTracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its origins and prevent future outbreaks.\nBlockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.\nWhat is Blockchain Decentralization?\nBlockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.\nHave you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?\nBlockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.\nInstead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.\nBlockchain guarantees your data\u2019s authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company\u2019s product inventory.\nPros and Cons of Blockchain\nBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.\nPros\nAccuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.\nOne of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.\nSafe, private, and easy transactions\nProvides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information\nCons\nData storage has limits.\nThe regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.\nIt has a risk of being used for illicit activities\nFrequently Asked Questions About Blockchain\nI\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.\nIs Blockchain a cryptocurrency?\nBlockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It\u2019s a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.\nIs it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?\nYes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.\nWhat is the most prominent blockchain company?\nCoinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.\nWho owns Blockchain?\nBlockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.\nWhat is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency\nWhat is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?\nGenerally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.\nFinal Saying\nBlockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won\u2019t be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CIOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

Each \"block\" contains data, and the blocks are linked in a chronological \"chain.\"\nKey Takeaways\nBlockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use has been as a transaction ledger.\u00a0 In Bitcoin\u2019s case, the blockchain is decentralized, so no single person or group has control\u2014instead, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.\nWhat Is a Blockchain?\nA blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared across a computer network's nodes. While it is best known for its crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, blockchains are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable, meaning it cannot be altered.\nSince a block can\u2019t be changed, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This reduces the need for trusted third parties, such as auditors or other humans, who add costs and can make mistakes.\nSince Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain use has exploded due to the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Solana, can be purchased through leading\ncrypto exchanges .\nBlockchains are versatile technologies that can be used for cryptocurrencies, payments, decentralized apps, supply chain tracking, and verifying identities.\nInvestopedia / Xiaojie Liu\nHow Does a Blockchain Work?\nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. The key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: entering and accessing information, and\nsaving and storing it somewhere . A blockchain is distributed, meaning multiple copies are saved on many machines and must match for it to be valid.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a\nblock\n(different blockchains have different-sized blocks). Once the block is full, the block data is run through a cryptographic hash function, which creates a hexadecimal number called the\nblock header\nhash.\nThe hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block's header, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name \u201cblockchain.\u201d\nTransaction Process\nTransactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your\ncryptocurrency wallet \u2014the application that provides an interface for the blockchain\u2014it starts a sequence of events.\nIn Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins.\nInvestopedia\nEvery node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because it chooses different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.\nThe nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases with every mining attempt. If the resulting hash isn't equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving\nthe reward .\nFast Fact\nGenerating these hashes until a specific value is found is the\nproof-of-work , which proves the miner did the work. The sheer\namount of work required to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes as much computational power and energy.\nOnce a block is closed, a transaction is complete. But the block isn't confirmed until five other blocks are validated.\nConfirmation takes about one hour\nto complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes).\nNot all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the\nEthereum\nnetwork randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. It's a faster and less energy-intensive process than Bitcoin's.\nBlockchain Decentralization\nA blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes\u2014computers or devices running software for the blockchain\u2014at various locations. This creates redundancy and maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record on one node, the other nodes would prevent it from happening by comparing block hashes. This way, no single node can alter information within the chain.\nBecause of this distribution\u2014and the encrypted proof that work was done\u2014the blockchain data, such as transaction history, becomes irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions, but private blockchains can also hold a variety of other information, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's inventory. Most blockchains wouldn't \"store\" these items directly; they would likely be sent through a hashing algorithm and represented on the blockchain by a token.\nBlockchain Transparency\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized, so all transactions are transparently viewable by downloading and inspecting them or by using blockchain explorers that permit anyone to see live transactions. Each node has its own copy of the updated chain as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.\nFor example, crypto exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. Although anonymous (except for their wallet address), the crypto that hackers extracted is easily traceable because the wallet addresses are stored on the blockchain.\nOf course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.\nIs Blockchain Secure?\nBlockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the \"end\" of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be altered.\nA change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block's hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would generally reject an altered block because the hashes would not match. However, a change can be accomplished on smaller blockchain networks.\nFast Fact\nNot all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.\nA new and smaller chain might be susceptible to this kind of attack, but the attacker would need at least half of the network's computational power ( a 51% attack ). On the Bitcoin and other larger blockchains, this is nearly impossible. By the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally rapid\u2014the Bitcoin network hashed at a rate of around 931 exahashes per second as of Dec. 15, 2025.\nThe Ethereum blockchain is not likely to be hacked either\u2014again, the attackers would", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp", "title": "Blockchain Facts: What Is It, How It Works, and How It Can Be Used"}}, {"text": "What Is Blockchain? | IBM\nTags\nBanking\nWhat is blockchain?\nAuthors\nStephanie\nSusnjara\nStaff Writer\nIBM Think\nIan Smalley\nStaff Editor\nIBM Think\nWhat is blockchain?\nBlockchain is a shared, immutable digital ledger, enabling the recording of transactions and the tracking of assets within a business network and providing a single source of truth.\nBlockchain operates as a decentralized distributed\ndatabase , with data stored across multiple computers, making it resistant to tampering. Transactions are validated through a consensus mechanism, ensuring agreement across the network.\nIn blockchain technology, each transaction is grouped into blocks, which are then linked together, forming a secure and transparent chain. This structure guarantees data integrity and provides a tamper-proof record, making blockchain ideal for applications like cryptocurrencies and\nsupply chain management .\nThe key benefit of blockchain lies in its ability to provide security, transparency and trust without relying on traditional intermediaries, such as banks or other third parties. Its design reduces the risk of fraud and errors, making it especially valuable in industries where secure transactions are critical, including finance and healthcare. In addition, blockchain helps businesses improve efficiency and reduce costs by streamlining processes and enhancing accountability.\nThink Newsletter\nJoin over 100,000 subscribers who read the latest news in tech\nStay up to date on the most important\u2014and intriguing\u2014industry trends on AI, automation, data and beyond with the Think newsletter.\u00a0See the\u00a0 IBM Privacy Statement .\nThank you!

Refer to our\u00a0 IBM Privacy Statement \u00a0for more information.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy\nThe evolution of blockchain\nBlockchain technology began with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, created by an anonymous figure or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology was designed as a decentralized digital currency to enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a trusted intermediary like a bank. The blockchain served as a public ledger, securely recording all transactions and preventing double-spending, a key issue for digital currencies at the time.\nWith the development of platforms like Ethereum in 2015, blockchain began to support\nsmart contracts \u2014digital contracts stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met.\nThis development broadened blockchain\u2019s real-world applications, extending into areas such as real estate, finance, supply chain management, healthcare and even voting systems. Over time, blockchain has grown well beyond its cryptocurrency roots, becoming a key player in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nToday, blockchain continues to evolve, with ongoing advancements aimed at improving scalability, privacy and its integration with emerging technologies like\nartificial intelligence (AI)\nand the\nInternet of Things (IoT) .\nAccording to a report from Statista, blockchain technology is forecast to grow by nearly 1 trillion US dollars by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56.1% since 2021. 1\nMixture of Experts | Quantum\nDecoding AI: Weekly News Roundup\nAn exciting new announcement on fault-tolerant quantum computing:\nIBM Quantum Starling\nwill arrive by 2029.\nJoin our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\nWatch the latest podcast episodes\nBenefits of blockchain\nBlockchain technology offers various benefits that transform businesses\u2019 operations, enhancing trust, security, traceability and efficiency across multiple industries.\nHere are some top\nbenefits of blockchain :\nGreater trust\nEnhanced security\nBetter traceability\nIncreased efficiency\nAutomated transactions\nGreater trust\nBlockchain creates a secure, members-only network, ensuring accurate and timely data access. Confidential records are shared only with authorized network members, fostering trust and creating end-to-end visibility across the system.\nEnhanced security\nConsensus among network members is required to validate data accuracy, and all validated transactions are immutable and permanently recorded. This capability guarantees that no transaction can be deleted, even by a system administrator.\nBetter traceability\nBlockchain offers instant traceability with a transparent audit trail of an asset\u2019s journey. In industries prioritizing\nsustainability , it enables direct sharing of provenance data, verifying ethical practices. It can also reveal supply chain inefficiencies, such as delays, driving greater accountability.\nIncreased efficiency\nWith a distributed ledger shared among network members, the need for time-consuming record reconciliations is eliminated. Smart contracts, which are stored on the blockchain, can automate processes and speed up transactions.\nAutomated transactions\nSmart contracts facilitate the seamless\nautomation\nof transactions, enhancing efficiency and accelerating real-time processes. When predefined conditions are met, they automatically trigger the next step, reducing the need for manual intervention.\nKey features of blockchain technology\nBlockchain technology contains several key features that enhance security, transparency and efficiency in transactions and data management:\nDistributed ledger technology\nImmutable records\nSmart contracts\nPublic key cryptography\nDistributed ledger technology\nAll network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. This shared ledger records transactions only once, eliminating the duplication of effort typical of traditional business networks.\nImmutable records\nNo participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it\u2019s been recorded in the shared ledger. If a transaction record\u00a0includes\u00a0an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.\nSmart contracts\nSmart contracts are self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain, where the terms are written in code and automatically executed when predefined conditions are met. They can be used for various purposes, such as transferring corporate bonds or triggering travel insurance payouts. By automating these processes, smart contracts speed up transactions, reduce the need for intermediaries and ensure transparency and security.\nPublic key cryptography\nPublic key\ncryptography\nis a method used to secure transactions and data on the blockchain by leveraging two cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key serves as an address for receiving cryptocurrency or data, while the private key is a confidential key that grants control over the associated\ndigital assets . The private key holder can authorize transactions, providing security and verifying ownership, while the public key allows others to send funds or data to the correct address.\nHow blockchain works\nBlockchain technology records transactions securely by linking data blocks together. Each block contains important details about asset movements and ensures the integrity of the entire process.\u00a0Here\u2019s how it works.\nRecords transactions as blocks\nEach transaction is recorded as a \u201cblock\u201d of data on the blockchain. These blocks capture key details about the movement of assets, whether tangible (such as a product) or intangible (such as intellectual property). The data within each block includes critical information, such as who, what, when, where, the transaction amount, and specific conditions like the temperature of a food shipment.\nIn addition, each block contains a timestamp, which records the exact moment the transaction is added to the blockchain. This timestamp ensures the chronological order of transactions and adds an additional layer of verifiability to the data, preventing any retrospective alterations to the recorded information.\nConnects blocks together\nEach block is linked to the previous block and the one after it, creating a secure chain of data. This chain is done through cryptographic hashes, unique identifiers for each block. The hash of a block includes data from the previous block, ensuring the exact sequence and timing of each transaction. The cryptographic hash makes it nearly impossible to alter any block without changing all subsequent blocks, ensuring the integrity of the entire process.\nBuilds an irreversible blockchain\nThe blocks are grouped in an irreversible chain known as a blockchain. Each new block reinforces the security and validation of the previous one, strengthening the entire chain.\u00a0This Bitcoin-based architecture\u00a0is what makes decentralized systems so secure and reliable.\nNodes in the blockchain network validate and maintain the blockchain by confirming each transaction\u2019s validity through consensus algorithms, ensuring the system remains secure and immutable. Proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) are some of the most commonly used consensus algorithms in blockchain networks, each helping to secure the system while validating transactions.\nEnsures trust and immutability\nWith each new block, the blockchain becomes more secure, making it nearly impossible to change past transactions. This immutability provides a trusted, transparent ledger that all network members can rely on, preventing fraud and ensuring that all transaction records are accurate and unchangeable.\nTypes of blockchain networks\nThere are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be public, private, permissioned or consortium-built:\nPublic blockchain networks:\u00a0 A public blockchain is open for anyone to join and participate in, such as the Bitcoin blockchain. While it offers decentralization, it also comes with drawbacks, including high comp", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/blockchain", "title": "What Is Blockchain? | IBM"}}, {"text": "Ahrefs vs Semrush: Which SEO Tool Should You Use in 2026?

But over the last few years they\u2019ve added A TON of new features.\nToday, Ahrefs has a bunch of features that make it a direct competitor to Semrush, including:\nKeyword research features\nKeyword\ncompetitor analysis\nBrand AI visibility monitoring\nTechnical SEO tools (like a\nsite audit feature )\nRank tracking\nThe bottom line is that Ahrefs and Semrush have similar features.\nTL;DR:\nSemrush wins overall for 2025. It outperforms Ahrefs in keyword research, LLM visibility, technical SEO, PPC, and pricing. The Semrush One bundle offers the best value for integrated SEO + AI Search optimization.\nGet the 14-day free trial .\nLet\u2019s get started.\nWhich Tool Has the Best AI Search Features?\nThe newest additions to Semrush and Ahrefs involve tracking brand appearances in LLM answers and citations.\nBut the two tools take different approaches.\nSemrush AI Search Features\nSemrush treats LLM visibility like something you can actually track day-to-day.\nTheir AI SEO Toolkit rolls up a visibility overview, competitor comparisons, and platform filters so you can see where your brand shows up across ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews/AI Mode, and Perplexity\u2014and where it doesn\u2019t.\nIf you want rank-style monitoring, Prompt Tracking lets you follow a custom set of prompts with daily visibility updates in ChatGPT and Google AI Mode.\nAhrefs AI Search Features\nAhrefs comes at the problem from the brand/entity angle.\nTheir Brand Radar tracks how often AI systems mention or cite your brand, benchmarks you against competitors, clusters prompts into topics, and shows share of voice across multiple AI tools (e.g., AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity).\nIt\u2019s built on a very large prompt set (Ahrefs\u2019 public numbers cite 150M+ prompts across six AI indexes).\nSo Ahrefs works well if you\u2019re after directional brand trends rather than prompt-by-prompt visibility tracking.\nAI Search Features Winner\nSemrush\nis the winner here for most teams. If you want prompt/keyword-level tracking with daily cadence and tight SEO workflows, Semrush\u2019s AI SEO Toolkit feels more actionable.\nChoose Ahrefs Brand Radar if your priority is brand-level benchmarking and AI share-of-voice across platforms rather than rank-style monitoring.\nWhich Tool Is Best for SEO Keyword Research?\nFirst, I decided to see which tool was best for finding new keywords.\nLet\u2019s see who came out on top.\nSemrush Keyword Research\nWith Semrush, you can see all of the keywords that a competing site currently ranks for.\nAbove is Semrush\u2019s Organic Research dashboard. Ahrefs\u2019 Organic Keywords dashboard looks fairly similar (see below), at least at the top, where they show keywords by position over time.\nBut while Ahrefs dives right into the specific ranking keywords and their standard data (like volume, keyword difficulty, ranking change, etc.), Semrush provides a LOT more in-depth keyword data between this report, their Keyword Overview report, and their Keyword Magic report.\nSemrush\u2019s Keyword Overview report adds a highly useful layer of personalization and analytical precision powered by AI, so you can better align with your specific SEO goals.\nHere are two standout metrics:\nTopical Authority\nchecks how authoritative your domain is on certain topics, helping you pinpoint where you can shine in search rankings. It analyzes content quality and relevance, helping to predict how well your content will perform in search engine rankings.\nPersonal Keyword Difficulty (PKD %)\ngives you customized keyword difficulty scores for your domain, making them more relevant to your specific situation. This means you can pick out domain-specific keyword opportunities that are easier to rank for.\nAhrefs Keyword Research\nAhrefs\u2019 Keyword Explorer is like most other\nkeyword tools\non the market.\nType in a keyword. And get a list of ideas for target keywords.\nWhat\u2019s unique about Keyword Explorer is the fact it lets you know how many clicks you\u2019ll get if you rank for that keyword.\nWhy is this important?\nIt\u2019s no secret that Google is packing the SERPs with features that \u201csteal\u201d clicks from the organic results, and Keyword Explorer takes this into account.\nFor example, the keyword \u201cleonardo dicaprio age\u201d gets 12k searches per month:\nWhen you search for that keyword, the answer shows up in a knowledge panel-style result.\nWhich is why only 1.6k people (around 13.3% of all searchers) actually click on an organic result for this keyword.\nKeyword Research Winner\nOverall, I have to say that\nSemrush wins this feature battle , as Semrush just gives you lots more personalized data, which makes it a more well-rounded keyword tool.\nAnalyze\nWhich Tool Is Best for Analyzing Backlinks?\nNext, I wanted to see which tool had the best\nbacklink checker\nfeature.\nSemrush has\n43 trillion backlinks\nin its database from 390 million referring domains.\nAhrefs says they have\n35 trillion (external) backlinks\nin their database from 213.3 million domains.\nSo, both tools have pretty huge backlink databases. But let\u2019s see which tool wins out when it comes to ease of use and overall functionality.\nSemrush Backlink Analysis\nRather than only showing the backlinks and their data, Semrush provides a very useful macro view of what\u2019s happening in a site\u2019s backlink portfolio to provide insights on how it\u2019s changed over time, how changes impact authority, and more.\nAhrefs Backlink Analysis\nAs the OG backlink analyzer, Ahrefs still has some advantages.\nFor one, the Broken Backlinks section is extremely useful for seeing where you can make some quick fixes redirecting pages that have 404 errors.\n[ss: ahrefs\u2013site-explorer-backlinko-broken-backlinks.png]\nBut I also love the \u201cLinking authors\u201d tab, which is a great quick snapshot to see which writers prefer a brand\u2019s content (and which content is being linked to by which people).\nThese are great insights for your PR team and can lead to useful collaboration for future link building.\nBacklink Analysis Winner\nThis was another tough one. But I have to say when it comes to backlink features,\nAhrefs just wins out .\nSemrush\u2019s expansive index is impressive, but Ahrefs does still provide a couple of metrics Semrush doesn\u2019t have.\nAnalyze\nWhich Tool Has The Best Technical SEO Site Audit Feature?\nAt this point, Semrush and Ahrefs both have robust technical SEO auditing capabilities.\nThey flag things like:\nBroken pages\nCanonical issues\nLarge file sizes\nSitemap problems\nMissing tags and attributes\nBut let\u2019s dive into their differences.\nSemrush Technical SEO Site Audit\nSemrush\u2019s Site Audit tool is extensive, checking for more than 140 issues across your site.\nI specifically like the layout, with easily accessible reports for:\nCrawlability\nHTTPS\nInternational SEO\nCore Web Vitals\nSite Performance\nInternal links\nMarkup\nThis makes it easy to instantly understand how your site is performing in each area of its technical SEO. And to dive in and fix any issues.\nI love that Semrush includes an \u201cAI Search Health\u201d score right at the top of the audit, which helps marketers assess any site\u2019s ability to be included in LLM answers.\nIt considers if any AI search bots are blocked, for example.\nNow that SEOs can\u2019t ignore LLM optimization, it\u2019s nice to have it front and center in their report.\nAhrefs Technical SEO Site Audit\nPerhaps Ahrefs\u2019 biggest advantage is that it has an always-on feature that crawls sites every minute.\nIf you need to be extremely on top of things or are an agency managing several accounts, it\u2019s convenient to be able to toggle this on and get notified if something goes wrong.\nThey also have an IndexNow integration, which helps spur faster indexing across multiple search engines simultaneously.\nTechnical SEO Site Audit Winner\nFor most brands,\nSemrush\nis the best pick for technical SEO. It has a well-rounded suite of technical flags and suggested fixes. However, if timeliness is a higher priority for you, consider Ahrefs.\nWhich Tool Has the Best PPC Features?\nSince many businesses run both\nSEO and PPC campaigns simultaneously , having integrated paid search insights can help you coordinate your organic and paid strategies.\nIt\u2019ll help you spot where to shift budget, identify keyword gaps, and avoid bidding wars with yourself across channels.\nSemrush PPC Features\nIf you want an actual PPC workspace, Semrush is it.\nThe Advertising Toolkit goes beyond competitor snooping to help you plan and launch campaigns.\nYou can mine rivals\u2019 spend, creatives, and landing pages in Advertising Research. Then jump straight into build mode without bouncing between tools.\nFor setup, the PPC Keyword Tool lets you structure campaigns and ad groups, dedupe keywords, and export directly to Google Ads Editor (you can also import your existing Google Ads data to clean it up first).\nThat alone can save you hours of CSV wrangling.\nAnd because Semrush blends paid and organic in one place, ", "metadata": {"source": "https://backlinko.com/ahrefs-vs-semrush", "title": "Ahrefs vs Semrush: Which SEO Tool Should You Use - Backlinko"}}, {"text": "Semrush vs Ahrefs: Which SEO tool is right for you in 2026?

It helps you cluster keywords by showing if you can rank for a more specific term by targeting a broader topic.\nMany SEOs find its\nKeyword Difficulty (KD) score\nto be one of the most reliable and easy-to-understand metrics in the industry.\nBacklink analysis\nSemrush:\nOn paper, Semrush has the larger index with\n43 trillion links .\nThe\n\"Link Building Tool\"\nis a standout feature. It streamlines the outreach process by suggesting target websites based on your keyword targets and your competitors' backlink profiles, making it easier to\nspot new opportunities .\nIt also includes a comprehensive\n\"Backlink Audit\"\ntool with a \"Toxicity Score\" that helps you quickly identify and disavow potentially harmful links that could hurt your rankings.\nAhrefs:\nThis is a core strength for Ahrefs.

It focuses on brand-level benchmarking, tracking how often your brand is mentioned or cited by various AI systems.\nThis provides a high-level view of your \"AI share of voice,\" which is ideal for brand managers who care more about directional trends than daily fluctuations on specific prompts.\nVerdict:\nFor many hands-on SEO teams,\nSemrush is more actionable\nin this area.

You can find top-performing content in any niche, see who is linking to it, and identify content gaps to exploit.\nThe new\nAI Content Helper\nhelps you optimize your drafts. It grades your content against the top-ranking competitors and suggests topics you might have missed.\nWhile it's great for digging into competitor ad strategies, it doesn't have the campaign planning and execution features that Semrush offers.\nSemrush vs Ahrefs: Pricing and plans\nThe pricing models for these two tools are fundamentally different, and it's something to understand before you commit.\nAn infographic comparing the pricing models and starting costs in the Semrush vs Ahrefs debate.\nSemrush:\nSemrush uses a modular,\ntoolkit-based subscription model .

After all, email marketing is a broad term, even if you\u2019re an expert on the subject. To remedy this, I sat down and candidly answered seven of the most frequently asked questions clients ask about email marketing.\nLet\u2019s take a deep dive into how this practice can work for you.\n1. What can I use email marketing for?\nPretty much anything! You can use email marketing for any stage of the buyer\u2019s journey, as long as you do it thoughtfully. The way I see it, your brand should always have something impactful to say to help move a customer to the next stage, no matter where they are in the journey. The buyer\u2019s journey is never linear \u2014 and you obviously can\u2019t anticipate every need \u2014 but email is great because we can try to anticipate behaviors based on past email or site interactions. It\u2019s very flexible.\nFor example, when marketing to builders, home improvement brands can build a personalized relationship with contacts by tailoring emails to the builders\u2019 respective stage in the journey. Is the builder still researching solutions to a construction challenge? Comparing some of the brand\u2019s own products? Looking for how-to information to educate and train their crew?\n2. Are there different kinds of marketing emails? What are they?\nThe first type of marketing email that comes to mind is a newsletter, which can be monthly, weekly or even daily. These generally talk about what\u2019s happening at your company or highlight industry trends, thought leadership topics or new products, feeding relevant content to your clients or customers. For example, some Wray Ward client newsletter topics are seasonal. Relevance is crucial \u2014 there\u2019s this thought that people will care about what you\u2019re doing because you\u2019re doing it, but most customers want to know how it will help them.\nBesides newsletters, some other common themes for email marketing include:\nProduct promotion Sales outreach and promotional discounts Lead nurturing emails to move recipients to the next stage in the buyer\u2019s journey\n3. What are some of the benefits of email marketing?\nThe biggest benefit is that people who receive your marketing emails have opted in to hearing from your brand and put some degree of trust in it. With email marketing, you can really nurture that trust and grow it by sending them specialized and tailored content about the products and services they are most interested in. Similarly, establishing direct relationships with recipients is another benefit. Along the way, more of your customers will spend time reading your emails as opposed to treating it like an interruptive message that they just scan and delete.\nOn the flipside, it\u2019s important not to abuse the trust customers place in you and your brand. Your outreach should never feel like spam due to email frequency or because you share content that doesn\u2019t interest them.\n4. How can I get started with email marketing?\nI\u2019ve talked to clients who say, \u201cWe want to do it, but we just don\u2019t have time,\u201d and while that sentiment might be true, it\u2019s often fueled by some misconceptions.\nThere\u2019s an idea that you need perfect designs or content to start utilizing email marketing, and that simply isn\u2019t true \u2014 in fact, those imperfections can even be leveraged. We have a client who said they wanted their email outreach to be \u201cscrappy and engaging,\u201d and I love that.\nIt\u2019s important to remember when starting out that any subscribers you\u2019ve accrued have opted in to hear from you. In other words, they want to be engaged and build a relationship. Creating a thoughtful strategy that you know is going to attract this kind of subscriber with relevant, helpful content is the best starting point.\nGet our latest news and insights delivered fresh to your inbox.\nYour email address\nSubmit\nOnce you have a strategy in place, you can get buy-in from your team and leadership to enhance your campaign and put resources into content creation, design and all of those elements that worried you to begin with.\n5. How do I measure success when it comes to email marketing? How will I know when it\u2019s working?\nIt\u2019s really important to identify your goal before launching a campaign; knowing the end point will help you figure out how to measure its effectiveness. Your goal should always be something that you can translate to a key performance indicator.\nFor example, lower-funnel, purchase-oriented emails need to be measured against conversion actions such as filling out a contact form or reaching out to sales representatives \u2014 anything that shows that they\u2019re serious about making a purchase or subscribing to a service you offer.\nIt\u2019s easy to measure campaigns against basic statistics including open rate, click rate and traffic to site. But unless you\u2019re looking purely for awareness, your goal should always be more intentional or directional. Sharing information with leads is important, but it\u2019s even more critical to understand if they\u2019re engaging with you in a meaningful way or are close to making a purchase of some kind.\n6. How can email marketing fit into my marketing automation strategy?\nEmail marketing is the star of the marketing automation show, with people sometimes conflating the two. As for how email fits into an automation strategy, there are a number of ways. For example, someone can fill out a form for a PDF document on your website, which will set off a chain reaction that sends the person emails.\nWhat goes on behind the scenes of an email marketing campaign is important, and that\u2019s where automation comes in. In fact, when a form triggers emails, that\u2019s an example of automation at work. Automation also allows for tools such as internal notifications that are sent to your sales team when someone fills out a form. Furthermore, any action that customers take can factor into lead scoring, which bubbles up to the sales team based on engagement, essentially saying, \u201cThis person is really engaged. You should reach out to them.\u201d\nWithout automation, you would have all of this engagement but potentially not know what to do with it. On the other hand, automation in tandem with email marketing helps you manage and scale your efforts.\n7. How can I make better use of email marketing?\nGetting something thoughtful and strategic in place is half the battle. Without a concrete plan, your emails might be reaching your audience but not building toward anything, which can potentially result in wasted efforts if your leads don\u2019t make the leap to customer status.\nOptimization will take your email marketing to the next level. You should never become totally complacent with even the most solid strategy. Instead,\nA/B testing and optimization\nbased on trends and previous campaigns will help you consistently make your email outreach stronger and more successful. \u201cOptimizations\u201d can be as small as changing the color of a call-to-action button or leaning into a new genre or tone in your content. These small but mighty improvements will build up to next-level email quality.\nPersonalization is a more advanced technique, but personalizing your emails based on data collected can also be effective in getting focused, relevant content in front of leads. With personalization, one email can look different to people depending on their interests or actions \u2014 and it\u2019s all possible through automation.\nTo learn more about increasing your productivity and efficiency with marketing automation techniques, check out our blog post detailing\nseven ways to boost your business using marketing automation .\nMarketing Automation / Jun 14, 2022\n4 A/B Testing Tricks to Elevate Your Email Marketing\nView Article\nMarketing Automation / May 10, 2022\n5 Things a CRM Solution Can Do for Your Business\nView Article\nMarketing Automation / Apr 26, 2022\nHow to Level Up Your Marketing Automation\nView Article\nLet's talk\nClose\u00a0-\nClose\u00a0-", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.wrayward.com/articles/7-email-marketing-faqs-answered", "title": "Email Marketing FAQ: Our 7 Most Commonly Asked Questions"}}, {"text": "FAQ on email marketing: AI disruption, owned audiences, and why the channel still wins in 2026\nNewsletter sign-up\nEnvelope Does my company subscribe?

AI agents are beginning to filter, summarize, and prioritize inbox content before users see it. Meanwhile, Google's zero-click search results are eroding organic traffic, making owned channels like email more valuable than ever. At the same time, Big Tech platforms are tightening bulk sender rules, and consumer fatigue is driving higher unsubscribe rates. This FAQ examines how email marketing is evolving in 2026, what challenges marketers face, and why the channel remains essential for brands that want direct access to their audiences.\nWhat is email marketing and why does it still deliver the highest ROI?\nEmail marketing is a direct communication channel where brands send messages to subscribers who have opted in to receive them. Unlike paid media, email delivers content to an owned audience without platform fees or algorithmic suppression. The channel consistently outperforms other digital tactics. In February 2025,\n26.9% of UK and US marketers said email delivered their best ROI , ahead of websites and blogs (22.7%), SEO (19.2%), paid search (16.1%), and social media advertising (11.4%), according to GetResponse. Email also requires modest investment:\nonly 12% of marketers worldwide allocate more than 15% of their budgets to email , while 22% allocate less than 5%, according to a Litmus survey. Consumer preference reinforces the channel's value:\n59% of adults worldwide say email is their preferred format for receiving offers and updates , according to a Woo and Klaviyo survey. This combination of cost efficiency, direct access, and consumer preference explains email's durability despite decades of predictions about its decline.\nWhy is email becoming more critical as zero-click search grows?\nGoogle's AI Overviews and featured snippets increasingly answer user queries without requiring a click to a website.\nZero-click searches now account for 69%\nof Google queries, up from 56% a year earlier, according to Similarweb's July 2025 report.\nFor marketers, this shift reduces the value of organic search as a traffic source. Content that once drove website visits now gets summarized and consumed without attribution.\nOrganic click-through rates drop 61%\nfor queries where Google AI Overviews appear, according to Seer Interactive.\nThis makes owned channels like email strategically essential. Unlike search traffic, email subscribers represent a direct relationship that platforms cannot intermediate. Brands that invest in list growth and engagement gain independence from algorithm changes and AI-driven content summarization.\nHow are AI agents changing email consumption?\nAI is moving from a marketer's tool to an inbox gatekeeper. Google's experimental AI agent, CC,\ndelivers daily email briefings that summarize information from Gmail, Calendar, and Drive , deciding what matters and surfacing it first. ChatGPT's Pulse offers similar morning updates using chat history and user preferences. This shift means AI systems become the first reader, editor, and sorter of messages. Google has an advantage because it already owns email, calendars, and storage, giving CC deep context and tight ecosystem control. For marketers, the implication is significant: subject lines and preview text may no longer determine whether messages get attention. AI assistants will decide what's worth surfacing based on relevance, sender reputation, and user behavior patterns. Brands that over-email or deliver low-value content risk being filtered out before recipients see them. Optimizing for AI agents, not just inboxes, will become a priority in 2026.\nWhat new deliverability rules are Big Tech enforcing on bulk email senders?\nGoogle, Yahoo, and Microsoft have implemented strict requirements for anyone sending more than 5,000 emails daily.\nThese standards require three key criteria : proper authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), low spam complaint rates, and one-click unsubscribe options. Their bulk mail controls are effectively impossible to overcome without compliance. The stakes are high given market concentration. Gmail (72.1%), Microsoft Outlook (33.7%), Yahoo Mail (20.3%), and Apple Mail (7.4%) make up the majority of mailbox providers used by email marketers worldwide, per Sinch.\n60.3% of US marketers consider spam filtering their biggest deliverability challenge , according to a Kickbox survey. These changes shift power from senders to recipients, similar to Apple Mail's 2021 privacy update. Marketers must audit domain authentication, enable easy unsubscribe links, and monitor spam rates. Legacy tools may still work for basic needs, but without modern infrastructure and cleaner lists, brands risk getting blocked entirely.\nWhy are consumers unsubscribing from brand emails at higher rates?\nMessage overload is driving consumer backlash.\n40% of US consumers unsubscribe from brand emails or texts weekly , according to GetApp. Consumers unsubscribe due to too many messages\n(60%), overly sales-driven content (44%), and repetitive or generic content (36%), according to a Woo and Klaviyo survey.\nGmail's new \u201cManage Subscriptions\u201d tool accelerates this trend by letting users unsubscribe from promotional emails in bulk. Brands that send most frequently appear at the top of the list, magnifying churn risk.\nTrust concerns compound the problem.\n67% of US adults avoid responding to emails because messages may be spam or a scam , according to a YouGov survey. This caution is warranted, as\n61% of US adults said they\u2019ve experienced an email scam attempt , per Google and Morning Consult.\nBrands already using segmentation and frequency controls will see less fallout, while those with poor targeting face accelerated list erosion.\nWhat drives email engagement in 2026?\nClear calls-to-action remain the most effective engagement driver.\n35% of marketing professionals worldwide say interactive buttons or CTAs are the most effective elements in emails , according to Litmus. Interactive forms (14%), surveys, polls, and quizzes (13%), and countdown timers (12%) follow. The top KPI for marketing emails is click-through rate, cited by 29% of marketing professionals, followed by conversion rate (24%) and revenue generated (17%), according to Litmus. Nearly a quarter (23%) report CTRs above 5%, while the majority fall below that threshold.

Check out our top FAQs on email marketing for what you might be missing.\nAs the world\u2019s largest and most experienced digital marketing agency network, WSI knows a thing or two about\nemail marketing . We answer the most frequently asked email marketing questions by business owners. Let's get started!\nHow Do I Ensure the Legality of My Email Marketing Subscription?\nBefore charging head-first into the effective tactic of email marketing, make sure that you comply with the relevant anti-spam and protection of privacy regulations:\nUnited States:\nCAN-SPAM Act\nCanada:\nCASL\nEuropean Union:\nGDPR\nAustralia:\nSpam Act 2003\nCreate a privacy policy that explains how customer data is collected, used, protected, and disclosed. Include a checkbox where subscribers have to physically click to agree.\nWhat Do Opt-In and Opt-Out Refer To?\nOpt-in\nis a positive action that gives user consent. It can be through a sign-up form on your website or a specific call to action (CTA) in your email campaigns.\nOpt-out\nlets a user refuse or withdraw consent, usually through a link in every email. To comply with commercial email laws, this option is a legal requirement.\nIt is best practice and email protocol that people have to opt in; you can't automatically opt them in and ask them to opt-out.\nIs an Unsubscribe Message Necessary?\nLinking to an\nunsubscribe page\nthat confirms whether the user really wants to opt-out from your mailing list can also be used to convince the subscriber that they should be on your mailing list.\nOpinions are divided on the necessity of this page. But, done correctly, an unsubscribe message offers insight into why readers are unsubscribing while encouraging them to re-engage.\nIs a Business Card Enough for Me to Add Someone to an Email List?\nThere is an option of a \u201c soft opt-in \u201d within the law of some areas if:\nYou obtained the email address \u201c in the course of the sale or negotiations for the sale of a product or service \u201d,\nYou only market \u201c similar products and services \u201d, and\nThe individual is given the chance to refuse or opt out of the marketing when you first collect the details and in every message after that.\nTo maintain the integrity of your list, include an opt-in box or unsubscribe link. If you're unsure whether you can use soft opt-in,\ncontact your WSI Consultant\nfor more advice.\nCan I Buy an Email List from a Reputable Email Scraping Source?\nEmail scraping uses\nharvesting bots\nto obtain lists of email addresses that are then used for bulk email or spam. While it may seem like a fast way to build your subscriber list, it\u2019s not recommended.\nNot only is it illegal in some countries, but it is a risky practice that could do tremendous harm to the reputation of your business.\nAs a Reseller, Can I Treat Leads From Vendors As Opted-in?\nBecause the requirements for collecting opt-in vary by country and region, it is best to\nconnect with your WSI Consultant\nto verify this with you.\nIs it Okay to Pull Contacts from ZoomInfo?\nPulling contacts from databases like ZoomInfo without permission is risky and can violate email marketing laws.\nWould You Recommend Creating an Email List from an Existing Pool of Active Customers?\nCreating an email list from your existing pool of active customers is the best way to grow your list, as they have already shown interest in your products or services.\nHow Do I Integrate Social Media and Email Marketing Campaigns?\nJoining social media and email marketing results in a formidable marketing mix. Because they each serve different sections of your target audience, they build on each other and provide a personalized buyer\u2019s journey for your customers:\nHave social links in each of your newsletters urging your email subscribers to follow your social media pages; encourage your social media followers to sign up for your emails.\nPromote giveaways, competitions, and other events on social media by emailing your subscribers.\nStipulate that entry to the social media giveaway, competition, or event requires email opt-in.\nDevelop trust by including social proof from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in your emails.\nHow Can I Use Social Media to Grow My Email Subscriber List?\nAttracting a fan base is easy with social media. However, social media is a tricky environment, and should trends change or you are put in\nFacebook jail , you risk losing your followers. Rather, use social media to grow your email list:\nSteer social media followers to your opt-in page:\nInclude a link to your landing page on your social bio.\nUse the\nclick-to-tweet plugin\nthat navigates to your opt-in page.\nHave a\nsign-up button\nat the top of your Facebook Page.\nUse social media to promote your premium, gated content, such as eBooks, templates, online workshops, and video tutorials. Link to a landing page that reveals a taster of the content \u2013 the full offering is accessible only after entering an email address.\nHost a Twitter chat that brings together like-minded individuals to discuss specific topics.\nHold social media competitions or giveaways. Tempt followers with a high-quality image of the prizes, include a catchy hashtag, and link to a landing page where participants submit their email addresses to enter.\nInvite your social media followers to your live-streaming videos and webinars in exchange for their email addresses.\nInvest in social media advertising to quickly generate email leads. Run paid campaigns on Facebook Ads, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, where you offer beneficial content for free in exchange for an email address.\nCapture leads using SlideShare\u2019s built-in lead generation tool.\nHow Do I Re-Engage an Old Email List?\nFact : the quality of your email list trumps its quantity. But just because a subscriber has disengaged doesn\u2019t mean they are a dead end. Instead, 63% of\nmarketers\nsaid re-engagement emails were \u201c very effective \u201d:\nSegment your inactive subscribers.\nDetermine the reason users stopped engaging:\nNot enough value for them?\nBoring or repetitive content?\nToo many emails?\nEntice disengaged contacts to return with something of value:\nSurveys or polls that make them feel heard.\nPromo codes or freebies.\nOnline contests or events.\nPersonalized product recommendations based on previous purchases.\nIs There an Automated Way To Allocate Individuals Who Opt-out an Inactive Status?\nIf you're using an EMS provider (like HubSpot, Sharpspring, VBOUT), then these platforms automatically track opt-outs and remove them from your list.\nConnect with your WSI Digital Consultant\nif you'd like to discuss that further for your business.\nHow Do I Clean Up and Verify My Email Address List?\nTo maintain your reputation, improve deliverability, and increase conversions, you want an email list that targets only people who want to receive your emails.\nEmail scrubbing should be done every six months:\nSegment your list to identify inactive subscribers.\nDetermine why they disengaged.\nReach out to re-engage inactive subscribers.\nDelete inactive subscribers.\nHow Do I Get Maximum Engagement From My Email Marketing (High-level, Technical People, Premium Clients, B2B?)\nProduce dynamic content that is rich with relevant storytelling, tips, and customer success stories. Most importantly, match your content to your target audience.\nCreate strong subject lines - short, descriptive, and intriguing.\nSegment your lists to personalize your emails for targeted connection with your subscribers.\nSchedule emails to boost your opening rate.\nDo You Recommend Sending Email Attachments?\nBecause attachments have been used to transfer viruses and malware, many spam filters block their delivery. The large file size can bounce and/or slow down mass email sends.\nWhat About Adding a Video to an Email?\nVideos are an engaging and entertaining method of communicating with your audience. Emails including a video can:\nIncrease email\nclick-through rate by 65% and open rates by 19%\nReduce unsubscribe rate\nby 75%\nHave a\n96%\nhigher click-through rate than those without.\nBest Practices for A/B Testing\nA/B testing compares different versions of a single email to measure the impact of small changes.\nAvoid results skewed by time-based factors by testing simultaneously.\nThe larger the sample, the more accurate the results.\nRemove emotions and respond according to the results.\nTest early and test often for the best results.\nThe most accurate results come from testing only one variable at a time.\nHow Does Viewing an Email In the Previous Pane Affect Analytics?\nA marketing email viewed in the preview pane will skew your analytics \u2013 but not necessarily always in the same way. It depends on the EMS, preview settings, and email platform.\nOvercome the issue by maximizing the impact of the content in the preview pane:\nStrategically arrange text and design elements at the top of your emails.\nCaptivate readers by hinting at the rest of the content.\nKeep your email within a width of 600 pixels.\nInsert a table of contents.\nWhat are Drip Campaigns, and What Should I Know?\nEmail drip campaigns fall under marketing automation. By automatically sending emails that engage and nudge customers in response to their behavior or according to a schedule, the messages are personal and relevant.\nTo design a drip campaign, establish:\nTriggers are the criteria that a user needs to meet to enter the drip campaign.\nConditions that initiate sending the next in the series, e.g., a number of days, a specific action. This is determined by the context of your drip campaign, e.g., webinar or gated content.\nActions refer to the emails, e.g., birthday wishes and cart abandonment.\nThere are many marketing automation platforms from which to choose.

Senator Murray continues to be the\nleading Democratic voice\nspeaking out for more investments in biomedical research and protecting NIH, and this bill is an important step in preventing the Trump administration from decimating the biomedical research enterprise Congress has built in a bipartisan manner over decades, which has long been the envy of the world and drives medical innovation that has saved millions of lives. Senator Murray and Democrats were able to reject Trump\u2019s proposal to cap indirect cost rates, reject the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to eliminate four NIH Institutes and Centers and consolidate the rest, and codify in bill language for the first time, funding levels for select NIH programs, including universal flu vaccine development, maternal mortality research and the Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health. The bill also prevents the Trump administration from implementing a misguided policy\u2014at the direction of the Office of Management and Budget over the interests of scientists\u2014to multi-year fund all of its new grants up front. This would have cut the number of new research grants NIH awards this year by the thousands\u2014instead, Democrats ensured that NIH will fund more new research into promising treatments and cures, not less.\n[CUTS TO CLINICAL TRIALS]\nSenator Murray began her questioning by pressing Dr. Bhattacharya on the Trump administration\u2019s devastating cuts to biomedical research. Over the last year, Trump and Dr. Bhattacharya have implemented many policy changes that have caused mass chaos at NIH and severely disrupted medical research. They froze or terminated billions of dollars of federally funded research, issued \u201csupplemental guidance\u201d to illegally cap indirect costs that support research infrastructure, and fired thousands of NIH employees\u2014staff and scientists, causing some NIH labs to shut down: \u201c NIH funds thousands of clinical trials around the world. For families, these trials really represent hope and a chance for new treatments and cures. But last year, 1 in 30 NIH-funded clinical trials were disrupted by the Trump administration\u2019s grant terminations, it affected more than 74,000 trial participants.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Bhattacharya, what do you have to say to patients who were receiving that life-saving treatment\u2014whose clinical trials were impacted by those cuts?\u201d\nasked Senator Murray.\n\u201cSenator, we made sure that if there was any disruption, that the researchers had resources available to make sure that patients receive continuity of care. Ultimately, we worked with researchers from across the country to make sure that the clinical trials were really focused on advancing health and not on other political agendas and renegotiated them. Ultimately, we have preliminary estimates, I think ultimately ended up maybe only a dozen clinical trials were terminated,\u201d\nDr. Bhattacharya answered.\nSenator Murray replied, \u201c The Trump administration terminated or froze 5,478 NIH grants last year. In less than 6 months, the Trump administration terminated 383 active NIH clinical trials. That included 118 cancer clinical trials. Those patients are in a race for time.\u201d\n\u201cCan you guarantee to us today that NIH will not terminate grants in this wide-ranging, haphazard way again this year?\u201d\nSenator Murray asked.\n\u201cSenator, I mean, most of those trials were restored\u2014\u201d\nDr. Bhattacharya replied in part.\nSenator Murray pushed back,\n\u201cMy question to you wasn\u2019t going backwards, it\u2019s going forwards. Do you guarantee you will not terminate any NIH grant trials this year?\u201d\nDr. Bhattacharya responded,\n\u201cSenator, in 2020, a very large number of clinical trials were terminated. It\u2019s hard to predict the future, but I will guarantee, I can guarantee, that we will focus our clinical trial efforts on advancing health, and not on the ideological.\u201d\n\u201c Tens of thousands of real people rely on these clinical trials. It\u2019s not easy to get into them, and I think we deserve an answer that\u2019s much clearer, more direct than you just gave,\u201d\nSenator Murray said.\n[ NIH ADVISORY COUNCIL VACANCIES ]\nSenator Murray continued her questioning by pressing Dr. Bhattacharya on his decision to disband the NIH\u2019s Advisory Committee to the Director and his failure to recruit and retain Advisory Council members across NIH. Last year, the cancellation of Advisory Council meetings caused a backlog of tens of thousands of grants in the NIH system, which was compounded with the firing of staff. Advisory Councils have been left with fewer members, undermining the expertise required to make decisions on funding grant awards. This has left huge gaps in both expertise and capacity for NIH\u2019s scientific grant review process:\n\u201cThis time last year, all of NIH\u2019s Institutes and Centers were prohibited from holding Advisory Council meetings\u2014which is the final step, it is mandated by law, before NIH can award any grants. Under your leadership, Advisory Council members have not been replaced at the end of their terms. And for the first time in NIH\u2019s 139-year history, you completely disbanded the Advisory Committee to the Director\u2014it hasn\u2019t met for more than a year. More than half of NIH Institutes are set to lose all of their voting Advisory Committee members by the end of 2026. In fact, one of the Institute\u2019s Council will have no members by the end of this month. Since grants cannot be funded without Council approval, this poses a very serious threat to NIH\u2019s ability to fund research.\u201d\nSenator Murray asked,\n\u201cTell us how many Institute Advisory Councils and other review panels have been disbanded under your leadership? And tell us how are you going to fix this?\u201d\n\u201c I\u2019ve ordered the institutes to nominate new members. We\u2019re working as fast as we can with dozens and dozens and dozens of new members, including for the Advisory Committee Director, I just sent up a slate. We\u2019re going to have those faculty committees working, there will be no delay,\u201d\nanswered Dr. Bhattacharya.\nSenator Murray pushed,\n\u201cWell, if you can provide this committee please, with information on the status of every one of these councils and your agenda for getting them done. You can\u2019t, by law, send any research dollars until those are in place and without any members.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a priority of mine to make sure that those councils are staffed,\u201d\nreplied Dr. Bhattacharya.\n[ BAN ON FETAL TISSUE RESEARCH ]\nSenator Murray concluded her questioning by pressing Dr. Bhattacharya about the NIH\u2019s recent\nban\non\nfetal tissue research , an irreplaceable modality for scientific discovery:\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, NIH issued a ban on fetal tissue research. This policy immediately halted all research that has led to groundbreaking medical advances\u2014from the development of the polio vaccine to IVF. This stops irreplaceable research into new treatments for everything from Alzheimer\u2019s to Parkinson\u2019s. What is the scientific evidence for NIH banning fetal tissue research?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said earlier, fetal tissue research has been declining in use because of the availability of new alternatives, including induced pluripotent stem cells and a whole host of other new technologies. We did a study, an investigation, to make sure that the impact, the scientific impact\u2014\u201d\nDr. Bhattacharya replied in part.\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t have any evidence that you\u2019re going to put in front of us, you\u2019re just saying something else is there, and there\u2019s not always better alternatives. And in fact, for stem cell research, there\u2019s very, very limited [options]. So, you\u2019re not presenting us any [evidence]. I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m asking. This seems to me like a political decision by NIH. You made the decision right when we were having a mass gathering of anti-abortion activists here in DC. So, you can see why all of us go, \u2018What\u2019s this about?\u2019 But I am very concerned that NIH, issuing this ban with very little notice, is going to have a huge impact on patients in this country. And I want you to commit to providing to us a complete list of affected projects, so we on this committee know what\u2019s been terminated\u2014hopefully by the end of this week,\u201d\nSenator Murray further pressed.\n\u201c Absolutely you can have that, but I\u2019m telling you, we didn\u2019t terminate projects. We recommended that the\u2014required that the scientists find alternatives, and there are alternatives available. Using tissue from aborted embryos and aborted babies, is not necessary for science,\u201d\nsaid Dr. Bhattacharya.\n\u201c We\u2019ve been around on this topic many times, we know full well the scientific r", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.murray.senate.gov/at-help-hearing-senator-murray-slams-trump-administration-on-chaos-at-nih-cuts-to-biomedical-research-and-clinical-trials/", "title": "Cuts to Biomedical Research and Clinical Trials - Senator Patty Murray"}}, {"text": "So yeah, I vibe-coded a log colorizer\u2014and I feel good about it - Ars Technica\nSkip to content\nText\nsettings\nStory text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nMinimize to nav\nI can\u2019t code.\nI know, I know\u2014these days, that sounds like an excuse.\nAnyone\ncan code, right?!

On a good day, I could probably even tell you what a \u201cpointer\u201d is.\nBut pulling all that knowledge together and synthesizing a working application any more complex than \u201chello world\u201d? I am not that guy. And at this point, I\u2019ve lost the neuroplasticity and the motivation (if I ever had either) to become that guy.\nThanks to AI, though, what has been true for my whole life need not be true anymore. Perhaps,\nlike my colleague Benj Edwards , I can whistle up an LLM or two and tackle the creaky pile of \u201cit\u2019d be neat if I had a program that would do X\u201d projects\nwithout\nbeing publicly excoriated on StackOverflow by apex predator geeks for daring to sully their holy temple of knowledge with my dirty, stupid, off-topic, already-answered questions.\nSo I gave it a shot.\nA cache-related problem appears\nMy project is a small Python-based log colorizer that I asked Claude Code to construct for me. If you\u2019d like to peek at the code before listening to me babble, a version of the project without some of the Lee-specific customizations is\navailable on GitHub .\nMy Nginx log colorizer in action, showing Space City Weather traffic on a typical Wednesday afternoon. Here, I\u2019m running two instances, one for IPv4 visitors and one for IPv6. (By default, all traffic is displayed, but splitting it this way makes things easier for my aging eyes to scan.)\nCredit:\nLee Hutchinson\nMy Nginx log colorizer in action, showing Space City Weather traffic on a typical Wednesday afternoon. Here, I\u2019m running two instances, one for IPv4 visitors and one for IPv6. (By default, all traffic is displayed, but splitting it this way makes things easier for my aging eyes to scan.)\nCredit:\nLee Hutchinson\nWhy a log colorizer? Two reasons. First, and most important to me, because I needed to look through a big ol\u2019 pile of web server logs, and off-the-shelf colorizer solutions weren\u2019t customizable to the degree I wanted. Vibe-coding one that exactly matched my needs made me happy.\nBut second, and almost equally important, is that this was a small project. The colorizer ended up being a 400-ish line, single-file Python script. The entire codebase, plus the prompting and follow-up instructions, fit easily within Claude Code\u2019s context window. This isn\u2019t an application that sprawls across dozens or hundreds of functions in multiple files, making it easy to audit (even for me).\nSetting the stage: I do the web hosting for my colleague Eric Berger\u2019s Houston-area forecasting site,\nSpace City Weather . It\u2019s a self-hosted WordPress site, running on an AWS EC2\nt3a.large\ninstance, fronted by Cloudflare using CF\u2019s\nWordPress Automatic Platform Optimization .\nSpace City Weather also uses\nself-hosted Discourse for commenting , replacing WordPress\u2019 native comments at the bottom of Eric\u2019s daily weather posts via the\nWP-Discourse plugin . Since bolting Discourse onto the site back in August 2025, though, I\u2019ve had an intermittent issue where sometimes\u2014but not all the time\u2014a daily forecast post would go live and get cached by Cloudflare with the old, disabled native WordPress comment area attached to the bottom instead of the shiny new Discourse comment area. Hundreds of visitors would then see a version of the post without a functional comment system until I manually expired the stale page or until the page hit Cloudflare\u2019s APO-enforced max age and expired itself.\nThe problem behavior would lie dormant for weeks or months, and then we\u2019d get a string of back-to-back days where it would rear its ugly head. Edge cache invalidation on new posts is supposed to be triggered automatically by\nthe official Cloudflare WordPress plug-in , and indeed, it\nusually\nworked fine\u2014but \u201cusually\u201d is not \u201calways.\u201d\nIn the absence of any obvious clues as to\nwhy\nthis was happening, I consulted a few different LLMs and asked for possible fixes. The solution I settled on was having one of them author a small\nmu-plugin\nin PHP (more vibe coding!) that forces WordPress to slap \u201cDO NOT CACHE ME!\u201d headers on post pages until it has verified that Discourse has hooked its comments to the post. (Curious readers can put eyes on this plugin\nright here .)\nThis \u201csolved\u201d the problem by preempting the problem behavior, but it did nothing to help me identify or fix the actual underlying issue. I turned my attention elsewhere for a few months. One day in December, as I was updating things, I decided to temporarily disable the mu-plugin to see if I still needed it. After all, problems sometimes go away on their own, right? Computers are crazy!\nAlas, the next time Eric made a Space City Weather post, it popped up sans Discourse comment section, with the (ostensibly disabled) WordPress comment form at the bottom. Clearly, the problem behavior was still in play.\nInterminable intermittence\nHave you ever been stuck troubleshooting an intermittent issue? Something doesn\u2019t work, you make a change, it suddenly starts working, then despite making no further changes, it randomly breaks again.\nThe process makes you question basic assumptions, like, \u201cDo I actually know how to use a computer?\u201d You feel like you might be actually-for-real losing your mind. The final stage of this process is the all-consuming death spiral, where you start asking stuff like, \u201cDo I need to troubleshoot my troubleshooting methods? Is my server even working?\nIs the simulation we\u2019re all living in finally breaking down and reality itself is toying with me?!\u201d\nIn this case, I couldn\u2019t reproduce the problem behavior on demand, no matter how many tests I tried. I couldn\u2019t see any narrow, definable commonalities between days where things worked fine and days where things broke.\nRather than an image, I invite you at this point to enjoy Muse\u2019s thematically appropriate song \u201cMadness\u201d from their 2012 concept album\nThe 2nd Law.\nMy best hope for getting a handle on the problem likely lay deeply buried in the server\u2019s logs. Like any good sysadmin, I gave the logs a quick once-over for problems a couple of times per month, but Space City Weather is a reasonably busy medium-sized site and dishes out its daily forecast to between 20,000 and 30,000 people (\u201cunique visitors\u201d in web parlance, or \u201cUVs\u201d if you want to sound cool). Even with Cloudflare taking the brunt of the traffic, the daily web server log files are, let us say, \u201ca bit dense.\u201d My surface-level glances weren\u2019t doing the trick\u2014I\u2019d have to actually dig in. And having been down this road before for other issues, I knew I needed more help than grep alone could provide.\nThe vibe use case\nThe Space City Weather web server uses\nNginx\nfor actual web serving. For folks who have never had the pleasure, Nginx, as configured in most of its distributable packages, keeps a pair of log files around\u2014one that shows every request serviced and another just for errors.\nI wanted to watch the access log right when Eric was posting to see if anything obviously dumb/bad/wrong/broken was happening. But I\u2019m not super-great at staring at a giant wall of text and symbols, and I tend to lean heavily on syntax highlighting and colorization to pick out the important bits when I\u2019m searching through log files. There\u2019s an old and crusty program called\nccze\nthat\u2019s easily findable in most repos; I\u2019ve used it forever, and if its default output does what you need, then it\u2019s an excellent tool.\nEven with a custom log format that spaces out the elements, this wall of text doesn\u2019t lend itself to a quick visual scan.\nLee Hutchinson\nEven with a custom log format that spaces out the elements, this wall of text doesn\u2019t lend itself to a quick visual scan.\nLee Hutchinson\nA little bit of color goes a long way toward improving scannability.

Not only that, the trailer also introduces a massive Leviathan creature known as\nTitan X\n\u2013 bigger than Kong and even Godzilla! This article details the things we've learned from this new teaser and what it means for the upcoming season of Legendary's Monsterverse series!\nThe Rift\nThe Rift is a portal between dimensions, creating a door into another world. Based on the footage shown, it looks like the Rift is opened while inside the\nAxis Mundi\n\u2013 the realm between Earth and the\nHollow Earth . It sounds like Monarch are responsible for this opening of the Rift, causing at least one massive new monster to pass through.\nTitan X\nTitan X\nis a massive Cthulu-like, Lovecraft inspired Kaiju. It is larger than both\nGodzilla\nand\nKong . Blending aesthetics of a giant Whale, Squid and Octopus, this new monster comes from a different world \u2013 passing through the opened Rift. This massive new threat manages to make its way from Axis Mundi, back to Earth where it wrecks havoc for the surface and for mankind.\nPhysical features of Titan X include massive tentacles, fins, dorsal spikes. A huge horn on the front of its head and a dual-iris within its eyes. Cave paintings teased in the trailer suggest Iwi or another ancient Human culture have knowledge about Titan X and perhaps once worshipped it as an ancient god.\nMonster Mites\nThe trailer shows a quick cut-scene of these large dog-sized bugs crawling through an island village. I suspect these ccrustacean-like insectoid monsters are a form of aquatic mite which travel on the body of the Leviathan. We don't yet have an official name for these creatures, but they are very reminiscent of the Kaiju Mites from Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim.\nGodzilla\nWe only get one magnificent shot of Godzilla in this trailer and it's a quick shot of him roaring in a cityscape. The perspective and cinematography remind us a lot of Gareth Edwards' 2014 original film in that moment.\nKong\nUnlike Godzilla's limited screen time, Kong was featured in a number of shots in this trailer. This may be an indication to reinforce\nour report about Season 2 focusing more on Kong\nthan Godzilla. The shots of Kong in the trailer seem to remain confined to Skull Island.\nSeason 2 of\nMonarch: Legacy of Monsters\nis definitely taking the series to a new level. Teasing a much darker atmosphere the next season brings larger scale and plenty of monster action compared to season 1.\nWatch the trailer now:\nWhat did you think of the Season 2 trailer?

Here\u2019s everything we know. by\nRyan Britt Feb. 3, 2026 Apple TV Can the Monsterverse be subtle? Two years ago, with\nMonarch: Legacy of Monsters ,\ncreators Chris Black and Matt Fraction proved the answer to that question was a surprising yes. Through 10 episodes from late 2023 to 2024,\nMonarch\nSeason 1 told an intergenerational tale that spanned the 1950s to 2015, interestingly insulated from much of the canon of the other Monsterverse movies. As\nBlack told\nInverse\nin 2023 : \u201cThere are big gaps in that cinematic timeline...there's a lot that happens in that time span that is not stated in the movies, so it gives us a pretty wide field to play in.\u201d And play they have!\nMonarch\nSeason 1 not only reintroduced Godzilla, but also recontextualized the nature and history of the monster-hunting agency, the titular Monarch. And, along the way, it revealed that the \u201cHollow Earth\u201d from the films has some timey-wimey qualities.\nSo, what\u2019s next for\nMonarch\nSeason 2? The short answer is: More flashbacks, more revelations about the timeline, and at least one giant new monster. Here\u2019s the full trailer for\nMonarch\nSeason 2, what we know of the plot, the cast, and the fast-approaching release date. Monarch\nSeason 2 Release Date\nMonarch\nSeason 2 will hit Apple TV on February 27 with the first new episode. There will be 10 episodes in Season 2 overall, and each new episode will release on Fridays. The final episode will hit on May 1, 2026. Monarch\nSeason 2 Plot and Timeline\nBecause Season 1 took place after the first 2014 reboot\nGodzilla\nfilm, much of the present-day action happened in 2015. But, by the end of Season 2, after being trapped in Axis Mundi \u2014 the Hollow Earth in which time flows differently \u2014 Cate, her grandmother, Keiko, and May (Kiersey Clemons) are brought in 2017, thanks to the efforts of Hiroshi (Takehiro Hira) and Kentaro (Ren Watabe). So this means the present-day events of Season 2 will take place in 2017, which is roughly two years before the events of the 2019 movie\nGodzilla: King of the Monsters. Monarch\nSeason 2 will also flashback to the early days of the titular organization, just as it did in Season 1. So, this will include events from the 1950s, as well as everything before 1962. After 1962, Shaw gets trapped in Axis Mundi and emerges in 1982. The post-1982 adventures of Shaw will likely not be explored in\nMonarch\nSeason 2 flashbacks, as that time period will likely be saved for the Lee Shaw spinoff series. Monarch\nSeason 2 Cast\nAnna Sawai will return in\nMonarch\nSeason 2. Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Shutterstock Nearly all of the cast from\nMonarch\nSeason 1 is expected to return for Season 2. This includes: Anna Sawai as Cate Randa,\nwho was on a quest to locate her real father in Season 1. Ren Watabe as Kentaro Randa , Cate\u2019s half-brother, who becomes a part of Monarch at the end of Season 1. Kiersey Clemons as May,\na coder who worked for Apex, a tech company. May joins Cate Kenatro and Lee Shaw in their quest to find the truth in Season 1. Mari Yamamoto as Keiko Randa , grandmother of Cate and Kentaro, part of the small group who founded Monarch in the 1950s. She travels to the present day in the Season 1 finale.\nAnders Holm as Bill Randa,\nanother founder of Monarch, and Cate\u2019s partner. He was played by John Goodman in\nKong: Skull Island . Wyatt and Kurt Russell\nin the dual role of Lee Shaw, a military man who, along with Keiko and Bill, creates Monarch. In the present, Lee was exiled by Monarch, and in the finale, was trapped in Axis Mundi. Joe Tippett as Tim,\na well-meaning Monarch employee.\nTakehiro Hira as Hiroshi Randa , a major player at Monarch in the present day. He\u2019s Keiko\u2019s son, and Cate and Kentaro\u2019s father, though they had different mothers. Mirelly Taylor as Natalia , the director of Monarch in the present. Dominique Tipper as Brenda Holland,\nan executive from APEX, who had dealings with May in the past. Amber Midthunder as Isabel,\na new character for Season 2 who has been described as a \u201cbusinesswoman.\u201d Is There A Trailer For\nMonarch\nSeason 2? After a quick teaser, which confirmed that Season 2 would focus on a new monster called\n\u201cTitan X,\u201d\nApple dropped a full trailer on February 3, 2026. This trailer teases the idea that Titan X was let out into the world perhap because of something Cate (Anna Sawai) did. The trailer also makes it clear that in the present, Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) wants to use both King Kong and Godzilla to fight the menacing sea monster-ish Titan X. We\u2019re also getting a lot more flashbacks in\nMonarch\nSeason 2, showing more of the younger Lee (Wyatt Russell), Keiko (Mari Yamamoto), and Bill Randa (Anders Holm) in the 1960s. This format is similar to Season 1, and could lead directly into the upcoming\nLee Shaw spinoff series. Monarch\nstreams on Apple TV.

About 1,250 people in the U.S. are infected with it each year, and about 172 people die from it annually.\u00a0 Most milk is pasteurized, which means it is briefly heated to a high enough temperature to kill germs. Raw or unpasteurized milk can contain multiple pathogens that can sicken people, including with listeria, influenza, tuberculosis, salmonella and E. coli, the health department said.\nPasteurization has \"greatly reduced milk-borne illnesses\" since it was introduced in the early 1900s,\nthe CDC notes . Pasteurized milk\u00a0 offers the same nutritional benefits \"without the risks of raw milk consumption,\" the agency says.\u00a0 New Mexico's Secretary of Agriculture, Jeff Witte, said the state's dairy producers \"work hard to provide safe, wholesome products and pasteurization is a vital part of that process.\" \"Consumers, particularly those at higher risk, are encouraged to choose pasteurized dairy products to reduce the risk of serious foodborne illness,\" Witte said. Florida officials issued a similar warning in August 2025 after 21 people, including six children, were\nsickened by E. coli and campylobacter bacteria\nlinked to raw milk from the same farm.\nThe U.S. has seen rising interest in raw milk, fueled by a range of \"wellness\" influencers promoting it online.\u00a0 The Associated Press \u00a0reported in 2024 that sales for the product appeared to be on the rise.\nEdited by\nPaula\nCohen\nMore from CBS News\nLos Angeles County confirms third measles case of the year\nWoman found shot to death in UI Health parking garage\nCrowd surrounds group believed to be ICE agents at Tacos El Primo\n16 New Yorkers dead in freezing weather, Mayor Mamdani says\nGo deeper with The Free Press\nTwo Whole Milks with . . .

While the newborn or their mother has not been identified, the New Mexico Department of Health said in a\npress release\nthat health officials believe the most likely source of the infection was unpasteurized milk the infant's mother drank during pregnancy. A listeria infection is an illness caused by bacteria that can spread through various foods, according to the\nMayo Clinic . While the symptoms of an infection in a newborn can be subtle, they may include reduced feeding interest, low energy, irritability, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. Because listeria bacteria can be found in soil, water, and animal waste, many common food items can harbor the bacteria, including raw milk, raw vegetables, certain processed foods, and cold-smoked fish. The New Mexico Department of Health said that while investigators cannot pinpoint the exact cause of the infection, it \"underscores the serious risks raw dairy poses to pregnant women, young children, elderly New Mexicans and anyone with a weakened immune system.\" Stock photo of raw milk\nGetty Dr. Chad Smelser, deputy state epidemiologist for the New Mexico Department of Health, said in the press statement that, \"Individuals who are pregnant should only consume pasteurized milk products to help prevent illnesses and deaths in newborns. Listeria can cause \"miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, or fatal infection in newborns, even if the mother is only mildly ill,\" the Department of Health said, adding that the condition \"is also able to invade the bloodstream of people with compromised immune systems, causing serious infections and sometimes death.\" Consuming raw milk products can also expose people to other pathogens, including avian influenza, Brucella, Tuberculosis, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and E. coli. That department noted that some of these diseases are particularly dangerous for children under 5 and adults over 65. Jeff M. Witte, New Mexico Secretary of Agriculture, said in the press statement that \"New Mexico\u2019s dairy producers work hard to provide safe, wholesome products and pasteurization is a vital part of that process.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's\u00a0 free daily newsletter \u00a0to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"Consumers, particularly those at higher risk, are encouraged to choose pasteurized dairy products to reduce the risk of serious foodborne illness,\" his statement continued.

With that in mind, we\u2019ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a\ncurated list of some of our favorites from GOG\u2019s catalog . At the end of every month, we\u2019ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have about 50 games to set in front of you.\nOnce or twice a month, we\u2019ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we\u2019ll feature one of the games from the list\u2014perhaps a retro game you\u2019ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out\nthe earlier articles in the series !\nIt\u2019s Christmas of 1994, and I am 16 years old. Sitting on the table in our family room next to a pile of\ncow-spotted boxes\nis the most incredible thing in the world: a brand-new Gateway 66MHz Pentium tower, with a 540MB hard disk drive, 8MB of RAM, and, most importantly, a CD-ROM drive. I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change\u2014at least where games were concerned.\nI\u2019d been working for several months at\nBabbage\u2019s store No. 9 , near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC\u2019s arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I\u2019d already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts\u2019 latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really.\nGimli and Luke, together at last!\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nGimli and Luke, together at last!\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nThe moment Babbage\u2019s opened its doors on December 26\u2014a day I had off, fortunately\u2014I was there, checkbook in hand. One entire paycheck\u2019s worth of capitalism later, I was sprinting out to my creaky 280-Z, sweatily clutching two boxes\u2014one an impulse buy,\nThe Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual , and the other a game I felt sure would be the best thing I\u2019d ever played or ever would play: Origin\u2019s\nWing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger . On the backs of\nWing Commander I\nand\nWing Commander II , how could it not be?!\nThe\nmovie\nis on my\ncomputer!\nIt\u2019s easy to pooh-pooh full-motion video games here in 2026; from our vantage point, we know the much-anticipated\n\u201cSiliwood\u201d revolution\nthat was supposed to transform entertainment and usher interactivity into all media by the end of the millennium utterly failed to materialize, leaving in its wake a series of often spectacularly expensive titles filled with grainy interlaced video and ersatz gameplay. Even the standout titles\u2014smash hits like Roberta Williams\u2019\nPhantasmagoria\nor Cyan\u2019s\nRiven \u2014were, on the whole, kinda mediocre.\nBut we hadn\u2019t learned any of those lessons yet in 1994, and\nWing Commander III\nwent hard. The game\u2019s production was absurdly expensive, with a budget that eventually reached an unheard-of $4 million. The shooting script runs to\n324 printed pages\n(a typical feature film script is less than half that long\u2014Coppola\u2019s working script for\nThe Godfather\nwas 136 pages). Even the game itself was enormous\u2014in an era where a single CD-ROM was already considered ludicrously large,\nWC3\nsprawled ostentatiously across\nfour\nof the 600MB-or-so discs.\nStill got these damn things in my closet after all these years.\nCredit:\nLee Hutchinson\nStill got these damn things in my closet after all these years.\nCredit:\nLee Hutchinson\nWhy so big? Because this was the future, and the future\u2014or so we thought at the time\u2014belonged to full-motion video.\nThe\nWing Commander III\nopening cinematic in all its pixelated glory.\nThat\u2019s\nWing Commander III\u2019s\nepic opening cinematic, upscaled for YouTube. Even without the upscaling and watching it on a 15-inch CRT, I was entranced. I was\nblown away . Before the credits were done rolling, I was already on the phone with my buddies Steve and Matt, telling them to stop what they were doing and\nget over here immediately\nto see this thing\u2014it\u2019s like a whole movie! A movie,\non the computer!\nSurely only Chris Roberts could conceive and execute such audacity!\nAnd what a movie it was, with an actual-for-real Hollywood cast. Malcolm McDowell! John Rhys-Davies! Jason Bernard! Tom Wilson! Ginger Lynn Allen, whom 16-year-old me definitely did not want his parents to know that I recognized! And, of course, the biggest face on the box: Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, representing\nyou . You, the decorated hero of the Vega campaign, the formerly disgraced \u201cCoward of K\u2019Tithrak Mang,\u201d the recently redeemed savior of humanity, now sporting an actual name: Colonel Christopher Blair. (\u201cBlair\u201d is an evolution of the internal codename used by Origin to refer to the main character in the previous two\nWing Commander\ntitles\u2014\u201d Bluehair .\u201d)\nI\u2019d watch Malcolm McDowell in anything. Malcolm McDowell is my cinematic love language.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nI\u2019d watch Malcolm McDowell in anything. Malcolm McDowell is my cinematic love language.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nOnce the jaw-dropping intro finishes, the player finds Colonel Blair as the newly invested squadron commander aboard the aging carrier TCS\nVictory , wandering the corridors and having FMV conversations with a few other members of the carrier\u2019s crew. From there, it\u2019s a short hop to the first mission\u2014because beneath all the FMV glitz, Origin still had to provide an actual, you know,\ngame\nfor folks to play.\nThrough a rose-tinted helmet visor\nThe game itself is\u2026fine. It\u2019s fine. The polygonal graphics are a welcome step up from the previous two\nWing Commander\ntitles\u2019 bitmapped sprites, and the missions themselves manage to avoid many of the \u201cspace is gigantic and things take forever to happen\u201d design missteps that plagued LucasArts\u2019\nX-Wing\n(but not, fortunately,\nTIE Fighter ). You fly from point to point and shoot bad guys until they\u2019re dead. Sometimes there are escort missions, sometimes you\u2019re hitting capital ships, and there\u2019s even a (very clunky) planetary bombing mission at the very end that feels like it directly apes the Death Star trench run while doing everything it can to shout \u201cNO THIS IS NOT\nSTAR WARS\nTHIS IS VERY DIFFERENT!\u201d\nThat salute is\u2026 definitely a choice.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nThat salute is\u2026 definitely a choice.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nThe space combat is serviceable, but the game also very clearly knows why we\u2019re here: to watch a dead-eyed Mark Hamill with five days of beard stubble fulfill our \u201cI am flying a spaceship\u201d hero fantasies while trading banter with Tom Wilson\u2019s Maniac (\u201c How many people here know about the Maniac? \u2026what, nobody?! \u201d) and receiving fatherly advice from Jason Bernard\u2019s Captain Eisen. And maybe, just maybe, we\u2019d also save the universe and get the girl\u2014either Ginger Lynn\u2019s chief technician Rachel Coriolis or fellow pilot \u201cFlint\u201d Peters, played by Jennifer MacDonald.\n(Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the primary purchasing demographic, players tended to overwhelmingly choose Rachel\u2014though this might also have something to do with the fact that if you don\u2019t choose Rachel, you can\u2019t customize your missile loadout for some important missions near the end of the game).\nWho doesn\u2019t enjoy a good old-fashioned space love triangle?\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nWho doesn\u2019t enjoy a good old-fashioned space love triangle?\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nWorth a revisit? Definitely!\nI will let others more qualified than me opine on whether or not\nWing Commander III\nsucceeded at the game-y things it set out to do\u2014folks looking to read an educated opinion should consult Jimmy Maher\u2019s\nthoughts on the matter\nover at his site,\nThe Digital Antiquarian .\nBut regardless of whether or not it was a good game in its time, and regardless of whether or not it\u2019s an effective space combat sim, it is absolutely undeniable that it\u2019s a fascinating historical curiosity\u2014one well worth dropping\nthree bucks on\nat the GOG store (it\u2019s on sale!).\nThere are cheats built into the game to help you skip past the actual space missions, which range in difficulty from \u201ccream puff\u201d to \u201cobviously untested and totally broken\u201d because just like in 1994, what we\u2019re\nreally\nhere for is the beautiful failed experiment in interactive entertainment that is the movie portion of the game, especially when Malcolm McDowell shows up as Admiral Tolwyn and, in typical Malcom McDowell fashion, totally commits to the role far beyond what would have been required to pull it off and turns in his scenery-chewing best. (He\u2019s even better in\nWing Commander IV,\nthough we\u2019ll save that for another day.)\nYou could find a worse way today to spend those three bucks.

Movie lovers everywhere reacted with a surprising amount of anger to Tarantino's dismissal of the Maniac and Lillard was very open at the time about how much it hurt. Now he's back to thank the fans who supported him. In an exclusive\ninterview with Entertainment Weekly , Lillard took the time to appreciate everyone who had a kind word.\n\u201cIt was like living through your own wake,\u201d Lillard describes of all the tributes he received from his peers in the business on social media. \u201cAll those R.I.P. emails or tweets and Instagram posts and TikToks, all of the things we see after somebody passes are so sweet. And the reality is I just got to live through all of it firsthand \u2014 alive and kicking! I can't imagine a more lovely reaction to what happened.\u201d\n\u201cIt was crazy. I keep showing it to my wife to convince her that I am worthy, that people still like me,\u201d Lillard tells EW, taking on a more jokey tone. \u201cI am a piece of ass!\u201d\nHe later adds, \"Nobody has to like me. Nobody has to like any actor out there, obviously. It's personal preference. I am not everyone's first choice, that is obvious, but to then have that kind of reaction was beautiful.\u201d\nYou can read the\nfull interview here .

standoff\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President\nDonald Trump\nis demanding a $1 billion payment from\nHarvard University\nto end his\nprolonged standoff\nwith the Ivy League campus, doubling the amount he sought previously as both sides appear to move further from reaching a deal.\nThe president raised the stakes on social media Monday night, saying Harvard has been \u201cbehaving very badly.\u201d He said the university must pay the government directly as part of any deal \u2014 something Harvard has opposed \u2014 and that his administration wants \u201cnothing further to do\u201d with Harvard in the future.\nTrump\u2019s comments on Truth Social came in response to a\nNew York Times\nreport saying the president had dropped his demand for a financial payment, lowering the bar for a deal. Trump denied he was backing down.\nAdvertisement:\nHarvard officials did not immediately comment.\nTrump\u2019s outburst appears to leave both sides firmly entrenched in a conflict that Trump previously said was nearing an end.\nLast June, Trump said a deal was just days away and that Harvard had acted \u201cextremely appropriately\u201d during negotiations. He later said an agreement was being finalized that would require Harvard to put $500 million toward the creation of a \u201cseries of trade schools\u201d rather than a payment to the government.\nThat deal appears to have fallen apart entirely. In his social media post, Trump said the trade school proposal had been turned down because it was \u201cconvoluted\u201d and \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d\nAdvertisement:\nHarvard has long been Trump\u2019s top target in his administration\u2019s campaign to bring the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities to heel. His officials have cut billions of dollars in Harvard\u2019s federal research funding and attempted to block it from enrolling foreign students after the campus rebuffed a series of government demands last April.\nThe White House has said it\u2019s punishing Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus.\nIn a pair of lawsuits, Harvard said it\u2019s being unfairly penalized for refusing to adopt the administration\u2019s views. A federal judge agreed in December, reversing the funding cuts and calling the antisemitism argument a \u201csmokescreen.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s latest escalation comes as other parts of his higher education campaign are teetering.\nLast fall, the White House invited nine universities to join a \u201ccompact\u201d that offered funding priority in exchange for adopting Trump\u2019s agenda. None of the schools accepted. In January, the administration abandoned its legal defense of an Education Department document threatening to cut schools\u2019 funding over diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\nWhen he took office for his second term, Trump made it a priority to go after elite universities that he said had been overrun by liberal thinking and anti-Jewish bias. His officials have frozen huge sums of research funding, which colleges have come to rely on for scientific and medical research.\nAdvertisement:\nSeveral universities have reached agreements with the White House to restore funding. Some deals have included direct payments to the government, including $200 million from Columbia University. Brown University agreed to pay $50 million toward state workforce development groups.\nBoston.com Tonight\nSign up to receive the latest headlines in your inbox, every night.\nSIGN UP\nLoading recommendations\u2026\nBe civil.\nBe kind.\nRead our full community guidelines.\nWant to leave a comment?\nCreate an Account\nOr sign in to your account\nTo comment, please create a screen name in\nyour profile\nTo comment, please\nverify your email address\nHere's what Boston meteorologists are saying about 'dangerous cold,' potential for snow this weekend\nA dispute over a shoveled-out parking space led to a stabbing in Dorchester, police say\nHere\u2019s what to expect these remaining weeks of winter, according to Dave Epstein\nHigh-end supermarket opening first Mass. location, alongside drive-thru coffee shop's second\nLocal obituary: Jaylin Rainford, 20, Catholic Memorial grad and Bryant University junior\nLawmakers urge Healey to\nprepare for possible state prosecutions of federal officials\nPolitics\nAdvocates, officials welcome judge\u2019s move to block end of protections for Haitian immigrants\nNational News\nMore Harvard connections to Epstein revealed in newly released documents\nClose Modal\nBoston.com Newsletter Signup\nBoston.com Logo\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

Stylists like them because they don\u2019t add visual noise to the side of a car. And aerodynamicists like them because they make a vehicle more slippery through the air. When Tesla designed its\nModel S , it needed a car that was both desirable and as efficient as possible, so flush door handles were a no-brainer. Since then, as electric vehicles have proliferated, so too have flush door handles. But as of next year, China says no.\nJust like pop-up headlights, despite the aesthetic and aerodynamic advantages,\nthere are safety downsides . Tesla\u2019s handles are an extreme example: In the event of a crash and a loss of 12 V power, there is no way for first responders to open the door from the outside, which has resulted in at least 15 deaths.\nThose deaths prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nto open an investigation\nlast year, but China is being a little more proactive. It has been looking at whether retractable car door handles are safe since mid-2024,\naccording to Bloomberg , and has concluded that no, they are not.\nHere\u2019s how you\u2019re going to do it\nThe new Chinese regulations are incredibly specific. For all new models introduced after January 1, 2027, there must be a recessed space that\u2019s at least 2.4 inches (6 cm) wide, 0.8 inches (2 cm) tall, and 1 inch (25 mm) deep for a hand to operate the handle, which can be semi-flush or simply a traditional door handle that we all know how to use.\nThe locking mechanism must be designed so that, in a crash that results in airbags deploying or a battery fire, doors on the non-impact side can be opened without tools. Chinese regulators are just as concerned that a vehicle\u2019s occupants don\u2019t get confused about how to open a door from the inside in an emergency. So each door must have mechanical releases where an occupant would expect to find them.\nAgain, Tesla is probably the worst offender\u2014its front doors have always had mechanical handles, but for some model years, the rears could not be opened without tools.\nFor cars already approved by the Chinese government (which includes everything currently on sale), there\u2019s a grace period. For existing designs, automakers have until January 1, 2029, to redesign their doors, and due to the specificity of the rules, that group of automakers is much larger than just Tesla. Xiaomi, which seems to be China\u2019s most-hyped EV brand, will have to redesign some models, but BMW will, too\u2014 the rather good iX3\nthat will go on sale there soon will also need a redesign. The same goes for cars from Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng.\nAnd unless there are exemptions for low volume, I would imagine that most supercars from OEMs like Ferrari and McLaren will need new doors for the all-important Chinese market. Indeed, given China\u2019s importance to the car industry, we should expect this ban\u2019s impact to be widely felt on any model sold globally. The benefit should be clear: fewer car occupants dying after being trapped in their cars.\nJonathan M. Gitlin\nAutomotive Editor\nJonathan M.

All car doors must include a mechanical release function for handles, except for the tailgate, according to details released by China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Monday. Officials said the policy aims to address safety concerns after fatal EV accidents where electronic doors reportedly failed to operate and trapped passengers inside vehicles. The new requirement for both internal and external door handles will take effect on Jan. 1, 2027. For car models that were already approved, carmakers will have until Jan. 1, 2029, to make design changes to match the regulations. Vehicles including Tesla\u2019s Model Y and Model 3, BMW\u2019s iX3, and other models by many Chinese brands feature retractable car door handles that could be subject to the new rules. Chris Liu, a Shanghai-based senior analyst at technology research and advisory group Omdia, said the global impact of China's new rules could be substantial and other jurisdictions may follow suit on retractable door handles. Carmakers will be facing potentially costly redesigns or retrofits. \u201cChina is the first major automotive market to explicitly ban electrical pop-out and press-to-release hidden door handles,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile other regions have flagged safety concerns, China is the first to formalize this into a national safety standard.\u201d It's likely that regulators in Europe and elsewhere will reference or align with China\u2019s approach, Liu said. The new requirements would impact premium EVs more as retractable door handles \u201care treated as a design and aerodynamic statement,\u201d he added. A draft of the proposed rules was published by China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in September for public comment. Last year, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nopened an investigation\ninto cases where Tesla\u2019s electronic door handles reportedly failed to work.

Left Center Right Ground G Logo Light Bias Comparison Ground G Logo\nBias Comparison On Monday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information\nTechnology\nbanned concealed door handles and mandated mechanical releases for cars sold in China, effective Jan. 1, 2027, with a compliance deadline of Jan. 1, 2029 for approved models. After several high-profile crashes, a string of fatal incidents in China, including Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan cases, and Bloomberg and U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probes highlighted trapped occupants and emergency-access problems. The new rules specify exterior recessed space of 6 centimeters by 2 centimeters , interior signage at least 1cm by 0.7cm, and mechanical release on passenger doors except tailgate. Automakers face costly redesigns estimated at more than 100 million yuan\nper model, affecting Tesla's Model Y and Model 3, BMW iX3, Xiaomi YU7, while some models revert to exposed handles. By moving first, Beijing positions China as a regulator whose standards other jurisdictions and global regulators may adopt, though experts warn redesigns will favor higher-margin luxury models and risk stifling innovation.
