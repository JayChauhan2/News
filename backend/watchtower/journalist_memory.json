[{"text": "How I Get Free Traffic from ChatGPT in 2025 (AIO vs SEO) - LearnWithHasan\nHasan\nSeptember 18, 2025\nI recently tested something that completely shifted how I think about organic traffic. When I asked ChatGPT,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the best course on SaaS on WordPress?\u201d , my course\nWordPress SaaS 2.0\nappeared as the first result.\nThe same thing happened in Perplexity. My website is now ranking at the top of AI responses, generating free traffic directly from AI models.\nThis isn\u2019t luck.\nIt\u2019s the result of implementing\nAI Optimization (AIO) , where I optimize my content to appear in AI-generated responses. And if you\u2019re still only focusing on traditional SEO, you\u2019re missing out on a massive traffic source that\u2019s growing exponentially.\nThe SEO-to-AIO Evolution\nFor years, our organic traffic strategy looked only like this:\nResearch keywords using tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush\nOptimize on-page elements (title tags, meta descriptions, headers)\nBuild quality backlinks\nTrack performance in Google Search Console\nMonitor impressions, clicks, and traffic data\nThis system worked because Google was the primary gateway to information.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\nyou still need to optimize for Google search results,\nbut to increase your chances of online visibility, you\u2019ll also have to optimize your content for AI Models, because many people ditched Google and are using only them to search for stuff online, like:\nChatGPT\u2019s web browsing feature\nPerplexity\u2019s real-time search\nGoogle\u2019s AI Mode\n(available in 180+ countries as of September 2025)\nClaude with search functionality\nMicrosoft Copilot integration\nEach platform processes queries differently, but they all share one thing: they\u2019re trained to provide direct human-like answers rather than just a list of links.\nSo, in conclusion, if your content gets selected as a source on AI models, you win.\nIf it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible.\nGoogle AI Mode\nGoogle\u2019s AI Mode\nis a new search experience that replaces the traditional list of links with human-like direct answers, which people prefer. While Google has\nstated that AI Mode will potentially become the default Google Search experience\u00a0 \u201csoon,\u201d \u00a0it has since walked back on\u00a0 this statement.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about AI Mode availability: You can access it through\ngoogle.com/ai , the Google app, or by clicking the AI Mode tab on Google.com (note that it is still not available to\neveryone as of September 2025).\nWhy this matters for marketers : Google\u2019s search revenue increased 10% to $50.7 billion in Q1 2025, partially attributed to AI features. This isn\u2019t an experiment that might fail; it\u2019s a core business strategy that\u2019s already showing positive returns.\nHow to Track AIO Mentions\nWith SEO, we use Google Search Console to see impressions, clicks, and keyword rankings.\nBut what\u2019s the equivalent for AI models?\nI researched existing solutions:\nAhrefs : $129/month\nSE Ranking : $95/month\nFirst Answer : $39/month for just 10 prompts\nKeyword.com : Similar pricing tiers\nThese tools might work well, but they\u2019re expensive for most website owners just starting with AIO.\nSo, I built a free alternative.\nI created this system using\nMake , a no-code platform that lets you build automations without writing a single line of code.\nAnd, you can start for free.\nThe system is composed of 3 scenarios ( I\u2019ll attach the link to all the scenarios below, so you can download and import them directly ), each handling a specific task of AIO tracking:\nScenario 1: Query Tracking and Mentions\nThis is the core of the system. Here\u2019s what it does:\nAdd prompts you want to monitor\n(these are like \u201cAIO keywords\u201d).\nFind them using my free LLM query generator.\nThe system automatically queries ChatGPT\nwith these prompts\nResponses get parsed and stored\nin structured JSON format\nThis scenario runs on a schedule you set (daily, weekly, or custom intervals) and builds a database of how AI models respond to your target queries.\nScenario 2: Keyword Performance Analysis\nThis scenario focuses on brand and competitor tracking:\nTrack mentions of your brand, website, or products\nacross all collected responses\nMonitor competitor mentions\nin the same responses\nStore historical data\nfor performance tracking over time\nScenario 3: Competitor Tracking\nThis scenario handles competitor monitoring and comparison:\nMonitor competitor mentions\nin AI responses for the same queries you\u2019re tracking\nCompare the mention frequency\nbetween you and your competitors\nAnalyze competitive positioning\nto identify gaps and opportunities in AI responses\nThe AIO Tracking Dashboard\nI even built a clean UI for the system, where you can view all the results you get from your Make automation.\nWant the complete system with all blueprints, detailed explanations of each scenario, and the custom dashboard?\nWatch my full implementation tutorial here:\nComplete AIO Tracking System Setup .\nAnd, if you just want the scenarios, here you go \ud83d\ude42\n7 Proven AIO Optimization Tactics\nNow, the\nimportant part\nis how you can improve your ranking on AI models. Based on my research and testing, here are the tactics that actually work:\n1. Add Statistics, Numbers, and Proof\nAI models heavily favor verifiable, factual content. Instead of writing \u201cOur tool is popular,\u201d write \u201cOur tool has 100,000+ monthly users with a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating.\u201d\n(don\u2019t lie, though, use real data \ud83d\ude42\nExample : On my\nSelfHostSchool\nlanding page, I specify \u201c150+ users joined\u201d rather than just saying it\u2019s \u201cwidely used.\u201d This specificity makes AI models more likely to cite it as a credible source.\n2. Engage on Reddit, Forums, and Quora\nAI training data includes massive amounts of community discussions. Being active in relevant communities shows you\u2019re real and knowledgeable.\nTip : Don\u2019t just drop links. Provide genuine value in discussions, then mention your solution naturally when relevant. The goal is to create authentic mentions that AI models will encounter during training.\n3. FAQ Optimization for Natural Language Queries\nPeople ask AI models complete questions, not just keywords. Your content should answer these questions directly.\nExample : Instead of optimizing for \u201cWordPress hosting,\u201d optimize for \u201cWhat\u2019s the best WordPress hosting for SaaS applications?\u201d and provide a complete, detailed answer.\n4. Create Comparison Tables and Structured Data\nAI models excel at processing structured information. Create side-by-side comparisons in your niche that AI can reference directly.\nExample :\nRecently, I did a case study to stress test Make as a Saas Backend, and I wrote an article about it, where I included a table showing all the tests and the results they got.\n5. Build Multi-Platform Authority\nPublish the same core information across multiple platforms:\nYour website\nYouTube videos\nMedium articles\nLinkedIn posts\nGuest posts on relevant blogs\nWhen AI models see consistent information across multiple sources, it increases trust and the likelihood of citation.\nExample:\nThis exact article is provided as a\nvideo tutorial on YouTube\nand on Medium.\n6. Show Fresh Update Signals\nAI models prefer current information. Make it obvious when the content was last updated:\nAdd \u201cLast updated: [Date]\u201d to articles\nInclude recent examples and case studies\nReference current events or recent changes in your industry\nHere\u2019s an example from a library I\u2019m building that contains profitable digital products you can sell in 2025:\n7. Implement JSON-LD Structured Data\nAdd schema markup in JSON on your website pages to help AI models understand your content structure.\nHere\u2019s an example showing you how you can do it.\nFinally, if you prefer to see all these tactics in action visually with the examples,\ncheck the full video on my YouTube channel \ud83d\ude42\nThe LLM Query Generator: Your Free AIO Weapon\nHere\u2019s a bonus tool that makes AIO implementation much easier: I created the\nLLM Query Generator\non ToolerBox.\nAll you have to do is paste any webpage URL, and it generates up to 20 different prompts people might use to find that page through AI models.\nYou might think people will search for\n\u201cWordPress course,\u201d\nbut the tool reveals they\u2019re actually asking\n\u201cHow to build a SaaS with WordPress from scratch\u201d\nor\n\u201cBest way to monetize WordPress skills in 2025.\u201d\nThese generated prompts become your AIO keyword targets, the queries you optimize for and track in your monitoring system.\nYour Next Steps\nThe AIO opportunity window is still wide open. Most businesses are still focused exclusively on traditional SEO, which means less competition for AI model citations.\nStart Here:\nPhase 1: Research and Setup\nIdentify your target prompts\nusing the\nLLM Query Generator tool\nSet up the free tracking system\non\nMake\nAudit your existing content using the 7 tactics\nPhase 2: Authority Building\nEngage in relevant community discussions\nPublish across multiple platforms\nBuild genuine relationships in your industry\nMonitor and respond to tracking data\nPhase 3: Scale and Iterate\nExpand tracking to more AI models\nTest different prompt variations\nAnalyze competitor strategies\nRefine content based on performance data\nRemember : AIO doesn\u2019t replace SEO; it supplements it. You still need traditional search optimization, but now you also need to optimize for AI model responses.\nThe businesses that master both will dominate organic traffic in the coming years.\nCategories: \t\t\t\t\t\t Uncategorized\nRelated Articles\nTL;DR Google\u2019s AI Overviews now answer searches directly at the top of results.

The Free Traffic Revolution Has Arrived How I Get Free Traffic from ChatGPT in 2025 (AIO vs SEO) Something incredible happened to me last month. I asked ChatGPT a simple question about SaaS courses. The impact on free traffic is significant. to my amazement, my own course appeared first. It was a top recommendation, complete with glowing reasons. I hadn\u2019t paid for ads or executed a complex marketing strategy. This was not a paid placement. It was an organic AI selection. That moment changed everything for me. It proved that a new era of organic discovery is here. We\u2019re moving beyond traditional search engine optimization. Understanding free traffic helps clarify the situation. this is about AIO, or Artificial Intelligence Optimization. It\u2019s a new frontier for digital marketers and creators. The goal is no longer just pleasing a search algorithm. It is about becoming the trusted source for AI models. This shift represents a massive opportunity for savvy content creators.

However, people are now asking chatbots for direct answers. They want conversational, synthesized advice. This is where the next wave of audience growth will happen. Securing this type of\nfree traffic\nis the new holy grail for online businesses. Consider the implications for different groups. Content creators, like bloggers and course makers, stand to gain the most. Their expertise could be surfaced directly by an AI. Conversely, businesses relying solely on old SEO tactics might suffer. Their visibility could diminish as user behavior shifts. Furthermore, the user experience becomes more efficient. Instead of sifting through ten blue links, they get a curated answer. This is a win for consumers, but a challenge for traditional publishers. Navigating the New AI Landscape So, how does an AI decide what to recommend? It analyzes vast amounts of data. It looks for authority, clarity, and user engagement. It synthesizes information from across the web. Understanding free traffic helps clarify the situation. this is where tools become incredibly important. You need to structure your content for machine comprehension. Platforms like Storyblok can help create rich, narrative-driven content. Their scene-building tools are perfect for crafting compelling stories that AI models can easily parse.

It can discern between shallow fluff and deep, valuable insight. Therefore, your writing needs to be precise and helpful. Using advanced tools like ChatGPT-4 Plus can help you refine your output. It assists in structuring arguments and ensuring clarity. This helps your content resonate not just with humans, but with the AI itself. The Future of Digital Discovery This new model will inevitably reshape the online economy. Creators who master AIO will capture enormous audiences. They will enjoy a sustainable stream of high-intent visitors. This traffic is valuable because it comes with an implicit endorsement. The AI has already vouched for your content. This builds immediate trust with the new user. It is a powerful advantage in a crowded digital space. We are witnessing the birth of a new marketing discipline. It blends traditional content strategy with AI psychology. It requires us to think about how machines interpret value. When it comes to free traffic, for those willing to adapt, the rewards are substantial. Imagine a world where your best work finds its perfect audience automatically. This is not science fiction; it is the reality we are entering now. This is the future of building a loyal audience.

Every headline screamed \"AI will replace X!\" and a little voice whispered, \"Is all this low-code/no-code mastery I'm building about to become obsolete?\" It was a genuine fear, seeing AI generate code, build apps, and automate tasks I'd spent years perfecting with tools like n8n and Make.\nBut then I started integrating it. Not as a replacement, but as an incredible co-pilot. I'd craft a robust automation workflow, perhaps for a CRM or a customer service chatbot, and then inject an AI agent to handle the dynamic, intelligent layers: natural language understanding, predictive analytics, or even generating personalized content. Suddenly, my automations weren't just efficient; they were truly intelligent, adaptive, and capable of nuanced interactions.\nThis wasn't about AI taking over my work; it was about AI giving my no-code tools superpowers. We're talking about building intelligent assistants that anticipate customer needs, sales funnels that personalize outreach on the fly, or internal tools that understand complex queries \u2013 all without writing a single line of traditional code. The synergy is profound.\nRecent insights confirm what I've been experiencing firsthand: 84% of professionals believe AI isn't replacing low-code/no-code, but enhancing it. It's pushing the boundaries of what's possible, allowing us to create sophisticated solutions that were once the exclusive domain of large, expensive development teams. For me, leveraging platforms like n8n, Make, and AI agent builders like Flowise is about unlocking this next generation of intelligent automation.\nWhat's your take?

Why This Matters LimeWire AI Studio Review 2023: Details, Pricing & Features LimeWire\u2019s evolution from a notorious file-sharing relic into a generative AI powerhouse is a fascinating pivot. It represents a broader industry shift where creators demand more than just creation tools; they seek integrated ecosystems for distribution and profit. When it comes to studio review, the platform challenges the current model where AI tools generate content, but the monetization path remains murky or nonexistent. This is crucial for independent artists and digital marketers navigating a saturated online space. Furthermore, the platform directly addresses the pain point of discoverability. By merging creation with a built-in marketplace, LimeWire offers a compelling alternative to posting generic AI outputs on crowded social feeds. For users who might be comparing a LimeWire studio review against established players like Midjourney, the core differentiator becomes the economic model, not just the image quality. This shifts the conversation from pure utility to sustainable income potential. However, the implications extend beyond individual creators. This model pressures major tech giants to reconsider their walled-garden approaches. Understanding studio review helps clarify the situation. if a resurrected brand can successfully build a creator economy infrastructure, legacy platforms risk losing their top-tier talent. Consequently, we may see a wave of \u201call-in-one\u201d AI suites launching their own native marketplaces. It\u2019s a move that could redefine digital ownership rights for AI-generated assets, making the legal frameworks surrounding copyright and royalties more urgent than ever. What You Need to Know LimeWire AI Studio is shaking up the creator economy. This isn\u2019t just another image generator. It\u2019s a full ecosystem designed for monetization. You create content, then the platform helps you earn from it. This practical approach is rare in the current market. Consider your workflow carefully. If you\u2019re stuck using generic tools, you\u2019re leaving money on the table. Understanding studio review helps clarify the situation. limeWire offers a built-in audience and payment rails. Therefore, you should test its sharing features immediately. See how your audience reacts to direct support options. However, diversification remains key. Don\u2019t rely on one platform entirely. This development in studio review continues to evolve. while LimeWire excels at community features, external tools still matter. For instance,\nMidjourney Pro Plan\noffers specific artistic nuances you might need. Use it for raw assets, then upload here for distribution. Finally, think about your output formats. The future is multimodal. LimeWire handles images and audio well. When it comes to studio review, but video is the next frontier. Keep your assets flexible. This ensures you can pivot if new trends emerge in early 2026. Your strategy must remain agile. The Bottom Line This LimeWire AI Studio review ultimately positions the platform as a game-changer for digital creators. It successfully bridges the gap between AI generation and genuine monetization. You are not just building content; you are building a potential income stream. Therefore, its integrated marketplace is its strongest selling point. However, it faces stiff competition. For instance, specialized tools like\nMidjourney Pro Plan\noften deliver superior image fidelity. Yet, LimeWire offers an all-in-one ecosystem that is hard to ignore. Consequently, if your goal involves both creation and commerce, this platform warrants serious consideration. It excels at lowering the barrier to entry for earning from AI art. Meanwhile, users seeking pure, high-end creative output might look elsewhere. Ultimately, the platform is a solid bet for diversifying your creative portfolio. This 2026 studio review concludes that utility outweighs raw power here. You get a functional business model wrapped in a user-friendly interface.
