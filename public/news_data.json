Nov 4, 2024 · OPEC+ extends output cuts On Sunday, OPEC+ , which comprises the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia and other allies, confirmed it would extend its output reduction of 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) into December. This extension follows a previous delay from October due to declining prices and weak demand. Feb 3, 2025 · Hong Kong/Atlanta/London – Oil prices have surged dramatically following OPEC+ ’s unexpected decision to implement production cuts. This article explores the factors behind this decision, the immediate effects on global markets, and the potential long-term impact on consumers and the economy. We’ll delve into the reasons for the cuts, examine recent market trends, and offer insights into ... Why did OPEC stop cutting oil? It didn’t give a reason for the decision to delay unwinding its voluntary cuts, but oil prices have been weak this year despite escalating tensions in the Middle East, pressured by China’s downbeat economy. Last month, OPEC reduced its outlook for oil demand for 2024 and 2025, citing data received so far this year. Will OPEC+ unwind its largest production cut next month? OPEC+ will unwind its largest production cut next month by boosting output by 547,000 bpd. The group has left the future of production cuts uncertain after September. Geopolitical tensions, such as U.S. pressure on countries like India to stop buying Russian oil, could lead to further changes in OPEC+'s production strategy. How will OPEC's March 3 announcement affect global oil production? That results in global oil production that is 0.9 million b/d less than our forecast of 102.2 million b/d for world oil consumption. Although we expected some OPEC+ countries to continue to restrict production, we expect the March 3 announcement to result in larger cuts to production than we had previously assumed. What if OPEC+ oil supply is sustained? If OPEC+ crude oil supply is sustained at current rates, all else being equal, global oil supply would rise to 107.2 mb/d by 2030 , 1.7 mb/d higher than projected demand, suggesting prices would have to drop to prevent an untenable stock build. The precipitous drop in oil prices in the early months of 2025 and an uncertain investment climate have prompted oil executives around the world to reevaluate their upstream priorities. In addition, after nearly five years of production restraint, the OPEC+ alliance has begun to unwind voluntary supply cuts of more than 2 mb/d that have been in place since 2023.
