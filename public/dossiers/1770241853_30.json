      "content": "Trump\u2019s comments on Truth Social came in response to a New York Times report saying the president had dropped his demand for a financial payment, lowering the bar for a deal. Trump denied he was backing down.\n\nHarvard officials did not immediately comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s outburst appears to leave both sides firmly entrenched in a conflict that Trump previously said was nearing an end.\n\nLast June, Trump said a deal was just days away and that Harvard had acted \u201cextremely appropriately\u201d during negotiations. He later said an agreement was being finalized that would require Harvard to put $500 million toward the creation of a \u201cseries of trade schools\u201d rather than a payment to the government. [...] That deal appears to have fallen apart entirely. In his social media post, Trump said the trade school proposal had been turned down because it was \u201cconvoluted\u201d and \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d\n\nHarvard has long been Trump\u2019s top target in his administration\u2019s campaign to bring the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities to heel. His officials have cut billions of dollars in Harvard\u2019s federal research funding and attempted to block it from enrolling foreign students after the campus rebuffed a series of government demands last April.\n\nThe White House has said it\u2019s punishing Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus. [...] In a pair of lawsuits, Harvard said it\u2019s being unfairly penalized for refusing to adopt the administration\u2019s views. A federal judge agreed in December, reversing the funding cuts and calling the antisemitism argument a \u201csmokescreen.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest escalation comes as other parts of his higher education campaign are teetering.\n\nLast fall, the White House invited nine universities to join a \u201ccompact\u201d that offered funding priority in exchange for adopting Trump\u2019s agenda. None of the schools accepted. In January, the administration abandoned its legal defense of an Education Department document threatening to cut schools\u2019 funding over diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
