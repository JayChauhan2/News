      "content": "Haruki_NLI\n\nWe know it's passed the DS, as the official Nintendo reported numbers had it at 10k behind as of September 30. It sold more than 10k the following week in Japan.\n\nAs for PS2 the only hard numbers we have are 155m in 2012, then 160m because they didn't report the pure profit of 5m PS2s made in the final year of production in 2013 for some reason. That number only came out when the Switch was getting too close for their comfort.\n\nI think the final PS2 ever produced has a number on it though.\n\nAlso worth noting it took PS2 price cuts, the cheapest DVD player, and 12 years, to hit 155m. Switch is at 154m in 8.5 and it just plays games, and never really got cheaper.\n\nDepends how you measure success doesn't it?\n\nEdited Fri 12th Dec 2025 by [Haruki\\_NLI] [...] Best-Selling Nintendo Switch Games - Every First-Party Title To Pass One Million Sales\nNintendo Direct Partner Showcase Announced For Tomorrow, 5th February 2026\nBest Final Fantasy Games, Ranked - Switch 2 And Nintendo Systems\nOverwatch 2 Ditches The Number In Huge Overhaul, Switch 2 Version Announced\nTalking Point: Nintendo Direct February Partner Predictions - What Do You Want To See?\nNintendo Explains Why Switch Games Are Still Getting Free Updates\nNintendo Expands Switch Online's Game Boy Library With Two More Titles\nNintendo Reconfirms Release Windows For Major Upcoming Switch 2 Games\nPreview: So Far, Super Mario Bros.

However it is worth noting that according to Wikipedia the PS2 had 4344 games while the Switch to date is at 4052, which excludes stuff like Arcade Archives and NSO Classics\n\nBasically, the IMO in your post is load bearing\n\nSome playlists: Top All Time Songs, Top Last Year  \nAn opinion is only respectable if it can be defended.

      "content": "Original story continues below:\n\nBut Switch sales are still slowing down. Per analysis from Circana's Mat Piscatella, it was only the second best-selling console for November, following the PS5 in both unit and dollar sales, with Xbox Series consoles in third. Overall hardware spending was flat, with 15% year-over-year growth for PlayStation hardware off-setting a 29% drop in Xbox Series sales and 3% drop on Switch. [...] Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was still the best-selling game this month, however, and is the second best-selling game of the year thus far. It trails only EA Sports College Football 25, which is now the best-selling sports game in U.S. history by dollar sales, and ranks among the 50 best-selling games of all time by the same metric.\n\nMario & Luigi: Brothership debuted at No.7 for the month, right behind Super Mario Party Jamboree at No.6. Both games' position on the chart only reflects physical sales, however, so it's possible the inclusion of digital sales could have pushed either higher. [...] A few other big new games this month aren't reflected on the best-seller charts for various reasons. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl launched on Game Pass, which means a lot of people played it for \"free.\" But it debuted at No.6 on Circana's Player Engagement Tracker Xbox Monthly Active Users chart, and it ranked No.9 for Steam MAUs, indicating it's doing all right for itself. In a similar situation, free-to-play Genshin Impact launched on Xbox in November, and debuted at No.10 for Xbox MAUs.\n\nAnd over on mobile, Pokemon TCG Pocket was the second best-selling mobile game by revenue worldwide in November, beating out the incredibly popular Monopoly GO. It was the sixth best-selling mobile game in the States for the month.",
