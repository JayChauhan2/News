Bridenstine then made the shocking announcement that he wants to entrust the EM-1 mission in June 2020 to existing private launch systems, instead of waiting for SLS to be ready. He did not say which private company he had in mind, but SpaceX would be a natural candidate with its Falcon Heavy rocket. United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy also would be a capable alternative. United [...] NASA's administrator said Wednesday its next heavy-lift rocket, the SLS, is running into additional development delays, and the space agency now wants to use private launchers for its next Moon mission. Boeing has spent years developing the SLS, or Space Launch System, which would be the most powerful rocket ever built, with the goal of resuming manned space missions to the Moon. A capsule for astronauts, Orion, is being built by Lockheed-Martin and Europe for the missions. After a three year delay, a first unmanned mission around the Moon and back, dubbed EM-1, has been scheduled for June 2020.

      "content": "But the launch never happened. While it was originally mandated to launch before the start of 2017 by the US Congress, the SLS was delayed. This would be the start of many further delays, with at least 16 taking place following the start of the program in 2010. The rocket became one of the most ridiculed projects in NASA\u2019s history.  \n\nHowever, it now appears that, finally, there is no need to delay the launch any longer. In August 2022, NASA announced that the SLS\u2019 first mission, Artemis 1, is planned for August 29. While the date is not set in stone, and additional delays could still occur, this is the closest we have come to the launch since the program\u2019s inception more than two decades ago. [...] Additionally, its development was much cheaper, shorter, and less problematic than that of the SLS. The simplest way to understand this is to take a look at the timeframe. Back in 2017, the year the launch of the SLS was first envisioned, the Starship was still just a concept. The latter has been through several iterations, and a whole development cycle, while the SLS continued to experience delays.\n\nSo, is there still a need for the SLS? NASA seems to think there is and is continuing to pour money into its development. The rocket\u2019s maiden launch will be the first test of the agency\u2019s conviction.\n\nUPDATE 08-29-2022, 16:00 (UTC +3): On August 29, approximately 40 minutes before the planned lift-off, NASA announced that the launch is being delayed due to SLS\u2019 engine problems.
