      "content": "According to orbital data and ground-based telescopic observations, they have lingered nearby for weeks at a time, particularly over the past three years. Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has approached 17 European satellites.\n\nBoth satellites are suspected of \u201cdoing sigint [signals intelligence] business\u201d, Major General Michael Traut, head of the German military\u2019s space command, told the Financial Times, referring to the satellites\u2019 practice of staying close to western communications satellites.\n\nA senior European intelligence official said the Luch vehicles were almost certainly intended to position themselves within the narrow cone of data beams transmitted from Earth-based stations to the satellites. [...] Luch 1 and Luch 2 are unlikely to have the capability to jam or destroy satellites themselves, the European intelligence official said. However, they have probably provided Russia with large amounts of data on how such systems could be disrupted, both from the ground and in orbit.\n\nMaj Gen Traut said he presumed the Luch satellites had intercepted the \u201ccommand link\u201d of the satellites they approached \u2014 the channel linking satellites to ground controllers that allows orbital adjustments.\n\nAnalysts say that with such information, Russia could mimic ground operators, beaming false commands to satellites to manipulate their thrusters used for minor orbital adjustments. [...] \u201cEven if they cannot decrypt messages, they can still extract a lot of information\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they can map how a satellite is being used, work out the location of ground terminals, for example,\u201d he added.\n\nPouzin also said that Russia now seemed to be ramping up its reconnaissance activity in space, launching two new satellites last year named Cosmos 2589 and Cosmos 2590. The vehicles appear to have similarly manoeuvrable capabilities to Luch-1 and Luch-2.\n\nCosmos 2589 is now on its way to the same range as geostationary satellites, which orbit 35,000km above Earth, Pouzin said.\n\nBut Luch-1 may no longer be functional. On January 30, Earth telescopes observed what appeared to be a plume of gas coming from the satellite. Shortly after, it appeared to at least partially fragment.",

[...] European intelligence and military officials increasingly fear that similar disruptive activities could be extended into space, exploiting the vulnerability of satellite networks that underpin modern civilian, commercial and military communications.\n\n\u201cSatellite networks are an Achilles\u2019 heel of modern societies,\u201d German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said in a speech last September. \u201cWhoever attacks them can paralyse entire nations.\u201d\n\n## Civilian Satellites With Sensitive Roles\n\nWhile the targeted satellites are primarily used for civilian purposes such as satellite television, officials noted that many also carry government and limited military communications, increasing the strategic significance of the suspected interceptions. [...] Officials believe the Russian spacecraft were positioning themselves within the narrow data transmission cones linking satellites to Earth-based ground stations, potentially allowing Moscow to record command signals used to control satellite orbits.\n\nThis could enable hostile actors to later mimic ground controllers, issue false commands, manipulate satellite trajectories, or in extreme cases, cause satellites to drift off course or re-enter the atmosphere.\n\n## Hybrid Warfare Extending Into Space\n\nThe suspected space interceptions come amid growing concern that Russia is expanding its hybrid warfare tactics in Europe, following sabotage incidents such as damage to subsea internet and power cables.",

[...] Maj Gen Michael Traut, head of the German military&#39;s space command,\n\nA senior European official also told the newspaper that the Russian spacecraft were probably positioned to facilitate satellite interceptions.\n\nThis is a cause for concern as sensitive information, including command data for European satellites, runs off old technology with no encryption capabilities.\n\nThe development comes after the German defence minister warned that the Russian spacecraft were shadowing satellites used by his country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nLast year, Boris Pistorius said Russian Luch Olymp surveillance satellites were trailing Germany\u2019s Intelsat satellites, which are also used by other governments. [...] He questioned the \u201cpurely peaceful nature\u201d of Moscow\u2019s behaviour and warned that Berlin had come close to \u201creal threat scenarios\u201d.\n\nAnalysts believe Russia\u2019s tactics in space are part of its broader \u201chybrid warfare\u201d campaign, which also involves sending drones into European airspace and severing important underwater cables.\n\nRussia, alongside the US and China, has one of the most technologically advanced space programmes in the world.\n\n\u201cRussia and China have expanded their capabilities for warfare in space rapidly over the past years,\u201d Mr Pistorius said in September. \u201cThey can disrupt satellite operations, blind satellites, manipulate or kinetically destroy them.\u201d",
