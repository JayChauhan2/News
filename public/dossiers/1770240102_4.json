We want to make sure you can name-drop it in your next Zoom happy hour, and answer any follow up questions without skipping a single forkful of salad.\n\nHere's the most efficient FAQ we could muster.\n\n## What is an NFT? Is it a cryptocurrency?\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens are unique, easily verifiable digital assets that can represent items such as GIFs, images, videos, music albums, and more. Anything that exists online can be purchased as an NFT, theoretically. [...] An NFT is \u201ca type of cryptographic token,\u201d Emerging Tech Brew writer Ryan Duffy explains, but NFTs are different from cryptocurrencies because they\u2019re not interchangeable. Think of Pok\u00e9mon cards: You can trade them, but a Gastly is not the same as a holographic Charizard. But a bitcoin is indistinguishable from another bitcoin.\n\n## Why would I want to own an NFT? Can I make money on it?\n\nOne reason to buy an NFT is for its emotional value, which isn\u2019t so different from physical objects...unless you\u2019re a total utilitarian. No one buys lip gloss because they need it. They buy it for the way it makes them feel. The same can be true for a GIF, image, video, or other digital asset. [...] The other reason is because you think it\u2019s valuable...and will only increase in value. And yes, you can make money off of an NFT by buying and reselling it for more.\n\n## How do you buy an NFT?\n\nThe process varies based on what platform you use. And there are a lot of platforms.\n\n##### Become smarter in just 5 minutes\n\nMorning Brew delivers quick and insightful updates about the business world every day of the week from Wall St. to Silicon Valley.\n\nOn Top Shot for instance, you register to join a waitlist that can be thousands of NBA fans long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you\u2019re randomly chosen to buy it. While Top Shot accepts USD as well as crypto, some platforms only accept cryptocurrencies, like OpenSea.\n\n## How do you know your NFT is authentic?",

      "content": "Most NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain are built following the ERC-721 standard, which dictates the transfer of ownership and how transactions are confirmed, along with how applications handle safe transfers (among other requirements). Approved six months after ERC-721, the ERC-1155 standard lets multiple NFTs share a single contract, reducing transaction costs.

The first NFT reportedly sold was \"Quantum.\" It was designed and tokenized by Kevin McKoy in 2014 on one blockchain (Namecoin), later minted on Ethereum, and sold in 2021. [...] ### Key Takeaways\n\n## What Is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)?\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets like artworks, digital content, or videos that have been tokenized via a blockchain. Tokens are unique identification codes created from metadata via an encryption function. These tokens are then stored on a digital ledger, while the assets themselves are stored in other places. The connection between the token and the asset is what makes them unique.",

      "content": "Legal ownership rights. When an NFT is purchased, the owner obtains the rights to the digital asset that lives on the blockchain. They do not receive legal rights to the underlying content, and intellectual property rights regarding NFTs can be complicated. If another party trademarks the artwork or item that an NFT represents, that party retains control over the legal rights of the intellectual property (IP) regardless of who owns the NFT. [...] Value fluctuation. Since NFT value is not purely economic, it can fluctuate based on the current social climate. For example, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sold his first-ever tweet as an NFT last year for over $2.9 million. Today, Dorsey's NFT tweet is owned by crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi. He listed the NFT for sale at $48 million and closed the auction with just seven total bids ranging between $5-$277.\n\n## Key takeaways\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. They act as certificates of ownership and authenticity over an object, tangible or intangible.\n\nNFTs and cryptocurrency are not the same. NFTs are traded using cryptocurrency.\n\nThe value of an NFT hinges on several factors, including social relevancy and scarcity. [...] Lazy Lions. Avatars from the Lazy Lions NFT collection are trendy among those in the NFT community. Upon their debut, between 3,000 and 4,000 of the 10,000 Lazy Lion NFTs released sold in just five hours. As of March 2025, the most expensive NFT available from this collection is Lazy Lion #3299, currently listed for 25.00 ETH or $66,045.37 USD.\n\n### What is an NFT collection?\n\nAn NFT collection is a group of assets that all fit within a certain theme and exist on a blockchain.\n\n#### Why do NFTs look like that?",

An NFT is a unique digital asset allowing for digital ownership through blockchain technology. Each NFT is non-fungible, meaning that it cannot be replicated or counterfeited and cannot be equal to another NFT exactly. [...] The primary current use case for NFTs is ownership of digital art, gaming and collectables. However, using NFTs to tokenize physical assets, such as art and real estate, is becoming more relevant. In other words, NFTs are beginning to have more real world utility.\n\n## Q: What is Ethereum and how does it relate to NFTs?\n\nA: Ethereum is a decentralized, open source blockchain that has smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the token native to the Ethereum ecosystem. The first NFT project to utilize the Ethereum erc-721 non-fungible token standard was CryptoKitties in 2017.1 Many NFT projects are listed on platforms, such as OpenSea, and are priced in ETH. Most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. However, other blockchains are also implementing their own NFTs. [...] The NFTs are not an investment. Rather, the NFTs are digital memorabilia intended solely for entertainment purposes. As entertainment memorabilia given to you as a gift, the NFTs have no value and are not intended by VanEck to ever have any value. Neither VanEck nor a else will take or not take any current or future action that is designed in any way to maintain the value of the NFTs, or to cause their value to grow or increase. You must not attempt to obtain an NFT from VanEck if you view it as an investment.",

We\u2019ve answered the top 5 questions about NFTs.\n\n## What are NFTs?\n\nAn NFT is a blockchain held token that at its most simplistic is a certificate of ownership over an original item, typically (but not always) a digital asset, such as artwork, audio, videos or even memes. As digital assets are so easily shared, downloaded or copied this provides ownership to one person for the original.  In real art terms think of it like the fact that anyone can own a print of Van Gogh\u2019s, The Starry Night, but there is only one original. The NFT is akin to owning an original digital asset. [...] ## When did NFTs become so popular?\n\nIn 2014 a digital artist minted the first NFT, Quantum. Following this, various other games, and platforms started utilizing NFTs and popularity started to build. But it was 2021 which saw the biggest boom, with the likes of Bored Ape Yacht Club attracting the attention of Eminem, Paris Hilton, and Snoop Dogg. McDonalds created the McRibNFT for a Twitter campaign, and the Kings of Leon\u2019s NFT provided fans with a limited-edition vinyl and front row seats to future concerts. And little old Quantum was sold for over $1.4 million in a Sotheby auction.",
