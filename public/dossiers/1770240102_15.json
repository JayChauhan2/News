The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI\u2019s Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes. [...] This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode.\n\nThis approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode\u2019s settings, it\u2019s possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally. [...] Apple began its big AI features push with the release of Xcode 26, expanding on code completion using a local model trained by Apple that was introduced in the previous major release, and fully supporting a chat interface for talking with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Users who wanted more agent-like behavior and capabilities had to use third-party tools, which sometimes had limitations due to a lack of deep IDE access.\n\nXcode 26.3\u2019s release candidate (the final beta, essentially) rolls out imminently, with the final release coming a little further down the line.\n\nPhoto of Samuel Axon\nLoading\nLoading comments...\nListing image for first story in Most Read: Netflix says users can cancel service if HBO Max merger makes it too expensive",

This time, Xcode will see newly added support for agentic coding with popular LLM chatbots like Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex.\n\nThat's right \u2014 Apple is bringing fully integrated vibe coding to Xcode. [...] While Apple believes it will be a useful aid for developers learning to code by hand, it may also open up more ways for vibe coders to quickly get their apps made and into the App Store.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple announced the upcoming release of Xcode 26.3. This time, Xcode will see newly added support for agentic coding with popular LLM chatbots like Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex.\n\nThat's right \u2014 Apple is bringing fully integrated vibe coding to Xcode.\n\n\"At Apple, our goal is to make tools that put industry-leading technologies directly in developers' hands so they can build the very best apps,\" Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations, said in an Apple Newsroom post. [...] Now, in Xcode 26.3, developers can install the chatbots of their choice and use them to quickly build or iterate on projects. Agentic coding allows Xcode to break down tasks, fix errors, and make decisions based on the project's architecture.\n\nInstalling agents is easy. In Xcode settings, there are one-click install options to integrate Claude and Codex. Agents are kept up-to-date automatically.\n\nAdditionally, a Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible agent will have access to Xcode 26.3 capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, there are new built-in tools that are designed to help models get a clearer picture of what is going on. For example, models can now take screenshots of the app preview and analyze them.",

On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude Agent and OpenAI\u2019s Codex, directly in Apple\u2019s official app development suite.\n\nThe Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later.\n\nThis latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple\u2019s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple\u2019s other hardware platforms. [...] Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.\n\nDevelopers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode\u2019s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).",
