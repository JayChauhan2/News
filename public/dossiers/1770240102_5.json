      "content": "Along with limited monetization options, Medium does come with some other limitations, especially when it comes to being able to customizing your blog. This can lead to issues with building brand and establishing sustainable content strategies, making it unsuitable for some businesses and professional content creators.   \n  \nThat said, Medium is a great option for bloggers who are just starting out in this industry and want to prioritize ease of use, user engagement, and writing over technical website management and customizations.\n\nPricing\n\nPublishing content on Medium is free. Although membership options are available starting at $5/mo, these options tend to focus on giving readers, rather than writers, extended functionality.\n\nRead our full Medium review here. [...] Setting up a blog on Medium is super user-friendly and needs no time or investment to start publishing. It has an intuitive editor that lets writers concentrate on their content, along with Medium\u2019s built-in user base. It is particularly great for new writers/ bloggers who want to reach like-minded users with their blogs without any involvement of separate websites or SEO practices.\n\nIt comes with a very minimalist design that holds the reader\u2019s attention and delivers a very neat, distraction-free experience. Another great feature of Medium is its robust community. You can have followers on your blog account, interact with them through comments, and even join or create publications on specific niches. [...] The post-writing interface is much like an ordinary desktop word processor (though some options are presented in a toolbar at the top, while others are in a menu at the side, which can be a little confusing at first). Time spent getting to know the interface is rewarded with advanced features like customizable social media sharing buttons, geotagging, and the ability to pick a custom style for individual posts.\n\nAs your blog grows, WordPress lets you track its stats, including page views, visitors, likes, and comments over time. You can also see how readers reach your site, which content they viewed, and where they are in the world, all of which are very useful in terms of being able to tailor your content accordingly.",
