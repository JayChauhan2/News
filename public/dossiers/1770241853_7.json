      "content": "### How are Blockchains used?\n\nEven though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nBlockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM\u2019s Food Trust uses blockchain to track food\u2019s journey before reaching its final destination. [...] Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.\n\n## Final Saying [...] ### What is Blockchain Decentralization?\n\nBlockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?\n\nBlockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.",

      "content": "Blockchain is a decentralized digital database or ledger that securely stores records across a network of computers in a way that is transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering. Each \"block\" contains data, and the blocks are linked in a chronological \"chain.\"\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n## What Is a Blockchain?\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared across a computer network's nodes. While it is best known for its crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, blockchains are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable, meaning it cannot be altered. [...] ## What Exactly Is a Blockchain?\n\nSimply put, a blockchain is a shared database or ledger. Bits of data are stored in files known as blocks, and each network node has a replica of the entire database. Security is ensured since the majority of nodes will not accept a change if someone tries to edit or delete an entry in one copy of the ledger.\n\n## What Is a Blockchain in Easy Terms?\n\nImagine you typed some information into a document on your computer and sent it through a program that gave you a string of numbers and letters (called hashing, with the string called a hash). You add this hash to the beginning of another document and type information into it. Again, you use the program to create a hash, which you add to the following document. [...] ## What Is a Blockchain for Beginners?\n\nA blockchain is a distributed network of files chained together using programs that create hashes, or strings of numbers and letters that represent the information contained in the files. Every network participant is a computer or device that compares these hashes to the ones they generate. If there is a match, the file is kept. If there isn't, the file is rejected.\n\n## The Bottom Line",

Read on for a crash course in all things blockchain.\n\n## Getting into the blockchain\n\nBlockchain, as it\u2019s moniker suggests, is blocks of data linked into an uneditable, digital chain. This information is stored in an open-source decentralized environment, in which each block\u2019s information is confirmable by every participating computer. It\u2019s designed to have decentralized management instead of the traditional hierarchical systems we\u2019re familiar with. A dispersed structure like the blockchain helps to ensure trust, validity and usability. [...] ### Blockchain beginnings\n\nWhile the idea of solidified blocks of data has been around for a while, blockchain technology as it is currently known is attributed to an individual with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed this new concept in a paper entitled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d A year later the currency was released to the public on the blockchain system as we know it. [...] While blockchain technologies are customarily discussed in relation to cryptocurrencies, the exciting applications are beginning to spill into debates and conversations in completely separate industries. These discussions range from data tracking to national currencies to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and all raise the question: what is blockchain capable of?\n\nIt turns out, a great deal. Blockchain technologies are already around us, whether you\u2019re aware of them or not. But what exactly makes blockchain technologies so noteworthy?
