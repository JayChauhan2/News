It recently released the soapy gay sports romance drama Heated Rivalry, which has since become one of its top-rated series.\n\nNetflix has struck an all-cash deal to acquire Warner Bros.\n\nWhen asked about whether Netflix plans to keep HBO Max as a separate service or combine the two, Peters stayed coy.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of thing we would want to sort out and we\u2019ve got some thinking originally,\u201d he noted. [...] \u201cWe want to do some more work on that one. But there\u2019s clearly, I would say, we know from our work in doing this with other providers that there are benefits.

The following month, WBD agreed to sell its studio and streaming operations to Netflix in a lucrative $82.7 billion deal.\n\nThe stunning agreement came after Paramount Skydance had initially offered to acquire the entire company, which includes prominent networks such as CNN and Discovery, beyond just the studio and streaming divisions. [...] As questions and concerns continue to swirl about what a merger could mean for the future of HBO Max and the talent behind its success, Peters has said he\u2019s confident the content will remain just as strong because \u201cwe\u2019re going to keep that HBO team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat HBO team is good at working with that talent and giving them the environment that they need to tell those amazing stories,\u201d he told Stratechery. \u201cAnd they get to do it under a great brand that speaks to the kind of program they\u2019re trying to make, and we\u2019re going to give them a bigger audience.\u201d",

      "content": "Acquisition Will Strengthen the Entertainment Industry \n\nHOLLYWOOD, Calif., Dec. 5, 2025 -- Today, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD) announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Netflix will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.\n\nThe cash and stock transaction is valued at $27.75 per WBD share (subject to a collar as detailed below), with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion (equity value of $72.0 billion). The transaction is expected to close after the previously announced separation of WBD\u2019s Global Networks division, Discovery Global, into a new publicly-traded company, which is now expected to be completed in Q3 2026. [...] Complementary strengths and assets: Warner Bros.\u2019 studios are world-class, with Warner Bros. recognized as a leading supplier of television titles and filmed entertainment. HBO and HBO Max also provide a compelling, complementary offering for consumers. Netflix expects to maintain Warner Bros.\u2019 current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.\n\nMore choice and greater value for consumers: By adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose. This also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers, enhancing viewing options and expanding access to content. [...] guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the Merger and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the Merger or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on",
