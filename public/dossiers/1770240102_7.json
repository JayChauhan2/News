[...] On Monday, Adobe announced that it would stop allowing people to sell subscriptions to Animate on March 1, saying the software had \u201cserved its purpose.\u201d People who already had a software license would be able to keep using Animate with technical support until March 1, 2027; businesses had until March 1, 2029. Per an email sent to customers, Adobe also said users would lose access to Animate files and project data on March 1, 2027. Animate costs $23 per month.\n\nAfter receiving backlash from animators and other users, Adobe reversed its decision on Tuesday night. In an announcement posted online, the San Jose, California-headquartered company said: [...] We are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content. There is no longer a deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.\n\nAdobe said the software will be available for individuals and businesses and will still receive technical support and security and bug fixes, but not new features.\n\nThe company said its Monday announcement \u201cdid not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring Animate users have access to their content regardless if the state of development changes,\u201d Adobe said.",

      "content": "Adobe is putting on hold its plan to discontinue Adobe Animate following intense backlash from its customers after it announced plans to shut down the 2D animation software amid an increased focus on its investments in AI.\n\n\u201cWe are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content,\u201d the company wrote in a post on Wednesday.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Monday announcement about discontinuing Animate was met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger, and users aired concerns about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate\u2019s functionality. [...] One customer, posting on X, had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like, \u201cthis is legit gonna ruin my life,\u201d and, \u201cliterally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the company updated its support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing that Adobe Animate would be discontinued on March 1, 2026. Enterprise customers would continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition, the company said at the time. Other customers would have support through March of next year. [...] There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction when no mention was made of Animate at the company\u2019s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.\n\nBefore switching to \u201cmaintenance mode,\u201d Abode had intended for the software to continue to work for those who have it downloaded. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.\n\nSome users have been recommending other animation programs to use as a replacement, including Moho Animation and Toon Boom Harmony.",

It was a ridiculous decision in the first place.\n\nn. tilcheff\nshihchiehc73951788\nMarc Martorell\nkglad\nCommunity Expert\nCommunity Expert\n\nlukasstudio\n\nAnimate is not just a \"web utility\" \u2013 it\u2019s an irreplaceable industry standard\n\n\"The recent announcement regarding Adobe Animate being moved to 'maintenance mode' suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of how this software is used today. Based on Adobe's communication, there seems to be a belief that Animate is merely a legacy tool for web banners and interactive internet content.\n\nThe reality is very different. [...] Commitments for long-term content/file access\n\nFor Adobe Animate, our commitment is to work with the community to ensure users continue to have long-term access to their content, regardless of the state of development of the application.\n\njust.emma\nfunyamora0032\nstunning_Spirit5E81\n\n## 25 replies\n\nI want to say\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s good and very much appreciated of Adobe to have listened to its customers - and not just stuck to a decision despite the backlash.\n\nAdobe could have easily just stuck to what it said and removed Animate - threats of people leaving CC subs would not be enough.\n\nI think it shows that Adobe is listening to its customers.\n\nAnd despite now being in maintenance mode - I\u2019ll continue with my cc sub while Animate is still the ONLY choice for html5 canvas app production. [...] We need to address two major concerns:\n\nAdobe, please realize that Animate is not a relic of the Flash-player era; it is a vital, living production tool. We don't just need 'bug fixes'\u2014we need a commitment that this industry standard will remain functional and supported on modern hardware for years to come.\"\n\nju5stin\nHelenWLee\nMarc Martorell\nrayek.elfin\n\nThe damage is done in my opinion. The news of Adobe discontinuing Animate went viral, and probably created so much anxiety and uncertainty that studios and indie animators are already looking to replace Animate in their pipelines.\n\nAs for OS compatibility: so far when an Adobe product was sunset in maintenance mode and OS updates broke compatibility they did not fix it.",
