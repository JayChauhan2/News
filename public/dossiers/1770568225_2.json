It questions the power dynamics and potential exploitation involved, which is a critical and often overlooked aspect of such medical advancements.",
  "uncomfortable_questions": [
    "Why is this experimental surgery being promoted now, and what commercial interests might be driving its development and publicity?",
    "Who is funding this research, and do they stand to profit from widespread adoption of this procedure?",
    "What are the long-term health risks for women who undergo this surgery, and who bears the cost if complications arise?",
    "How does this experimental surgery compare in safety and efficacy to existing fertility preservation methods for cancer survivors?",
    "What power dynamics exist between the medical institutions promoting this surgery and the vulnerable cancer survivors being recruited as subjects?",
    "Are there alternative, less invasive approaches to helping cancer survivors conceive that are being overlooked or underfunded?",
    "What are the ethical implications of performing experimental surgeries on cancer survivors who may feel desperate to have children?",
    "How are the success rates of this surgery being measured, and who verifies these claims independently?",
    "What are the potential psychological impacts on women if the surgery fails, and who provides support for them?",
    "Is the focus on this experimental surgery diverting attention and resources from other critical areas of cancer survivorship care?"

  "missing_context": "The article lacks specific details about the experimental surgery itself, such as the procedure, success rates, potential risks, and long-term outcomes for both mothers and babies. It also doesn't mention any patient testimonials or quotes from medical professionals involved in the study. Historical context about previous attempts at similar surgeries or advancements in reproductive technology for cancer survivors is missing. Additionally, there's no information about potential conflicts of interest, such as funding sources or affiliations of the researchers involved.",

The goals of this analysis were to evaluate cancer research designs for inclusiveness, weigh the ethical consequences of each approach, and identify areas of potential improvement for health disparities research. What are ethical guidelines for clinical research? Ethical guidelines are established for clinical research to protect patient volunteers and to preserve the integrity of the science. NIH Clinical Center researchers published seven main principles to guide the conduct of ethical research: Every research study is designed to answer a specific question . Is there an ethical framework for Cancer Research? In cancer research, equitable inclusion of patients is a part of ethical oversight. Similar to inherent health disparities, there are ethical consequences of choice of study design that are unique to each stage of research. Yet, a full ethical framework for cancer research has not been realized 8, 9. What are ethical dilemmas in the medical sub-specialty of Oncology? The medical sub-specialty of Oncology presents diverse ethical dilemmas, often challenging cancer healthcare workers with difficult-to-handle clinical scenarios that are tough from a personal and professional perspective. Making decisions on patient ... Are surgeons ethical? Ethics lie at the core of professionalism: a proficient surgeon is considered to be not only competent to perform the art and science of surgery as traditionally understood, but also to be ethically and morally reliable. The principlism and the four-box model approaches to clinical ethics could serve as a guide to the surgical ethics discussion. Jun 15, 2020 \u00b7 For that reason, we will first define the scope of surgical ethics , then we will present the main ethical issues faced by surgeons and how surgeons deal with them. Finally, I will show the implications of the development of surgery ethics for patients , surgeons and society.",
