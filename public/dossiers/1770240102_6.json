[...] It\u2019s not clear whether Border Patrol agents recognized Pretti before killing him this past weekend. But a DHS memo earlier this month told agents in Minneapolis to \u201ccapture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.\u201d A source also told CNN that federal agents knew Pretti\u2019s name, without clarifying if he was in this database. [...] Federal agents from the agencies were asked to fill out a form titled \u201cintel collection non-arrests,\u201d and \u201ccapture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form,\u201d according to communications obtained by CNN.\n\nAmong the likely subjects of this massive surveillance scheme was Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old ICU nurse who was killed by Customs and Border Protection agents in broad daylight. A few days before he was killed, Pretti was beaten by a group of federal agents he was monitoring, and suffered a broken rib. A source told CNN that federal agents knew Pretti\u2019s name, but did not clarify if he was in this database.",

[...] \"I do not want to hear that everything's been done here has been perfect. Nothing's ever perfect. Anything can be improved on. And what we've been working on is making this operation safer, more efficient by the book,\" Homan said.\n\nReuters reports one of those changes is a memo headlined \"DO NOT COMMUNICATE OR ENGAGE WITH AGITATORS.\"\n\n\"It serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation. No one is going to convince the other. The only communication should be the officers issuing commands,\" the memo reportedly reads.\n\n\"I believe they're still going to be around and still going to be terrorizing us,\" Mary said.\n\nMary's skepticism is shared by many of her neighbors, like this group, who are watching out for ICE in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood.

      "title": "Memo tells ICE officers they can enter homes without a warrant",
      "content": "The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: \u201cAlthough the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.\u201d\n\nThe memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be. [...] Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a \u201csafe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.\u201d\n\n## Memo says ICE officers are told to rely solely on administrative warrants\n\nICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president\u2019s mass deportation agenda. They\u2019re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.\n\nDuring a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment. [...] The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president\u2019s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo\u2019s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.\n\nIt is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man, Garrison Gibson, with a deportation order from 2023 in Minneapolis on Jan. 11, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.",

This incident involved Border Patrol, an immigration agency which works alongside ICE.\n\n## What is ICE and when was it formed?\n\nICE is taking the lead in carrying out the Trump administration's mass deportation initiative, which was a central promise of Trump's election campaign.\n\nThe US president has significantly expanded ICE, its budget and its mission since returning to the White House.

Protesters carry signs that say \"ICE OUT\".\n\nMany communities have pushed back when ICE and partner agencies like the Border Patrol carry out operations.\n\nIt is now common for residents to film ICE agents as they carry out arrests. Some encounters between ICE and the public have become aggressive or violent.\n\nDuring ICE operations in Chicago, Illinois, a collective of media organisations sued the Border Patrol. They alleged agents used improper force against journalists, religious leaders and protesters.",
