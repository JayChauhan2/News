      "content": "The documents were filed as part of Google\u2019s long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024. While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge, the company\u2019s plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial.\n\nAs Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser (which it did). In Judge Amit Mehta\u2019s final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans. [...] Google\u2019s Android chief, Sameer Samat, previously testified that Google was aiming to launch its first Aluminium machines in 2026. However, the new filings expand on that, saying that Google hopes to get Aluminium in the hands of trusted testers by late 2026. A full retail release may not happen until 2028. Google expects Aluminium to supplant ChromeOS in enterprise and education, which puts Chromebooks on the chopping block. Outside of a pandemic-era bump as workers sought cheap at-home machines, Chromebooks have never expanded much beyond those markets. [...] The documents suggest that Google will wash its hands of ChromeOS once the current support window closes. Google promises 10 years of Chromebook support, but that\u2019s not counted from the date of purchase\u2014Chromebooks are based on a handful of hardware platforms dictated by Google, with the most recent launching in 2023. That means Google has to support the newest devices through 2033. The \u201ctimeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034,\u201d says the filing.\n\n## Android goes big",

[...] The Broader Pattern of Google Product Evolution\n\nChromeOS\u2019s apparent expiration date fits into a broader pattern of Google product evolution and, occasionally, abandonment.

Google Reader, Google+, and numerous other products have met this fate, sometimes to the vocal dismay of dedicated user communities. [...] The court filings do not specify a timeline for ChromeOS\u2019s end-of-life, and Google has not made any public announcements about deprecating the platform. However, the mere acknowledgment in legal documents that ChromeOS has a finite lifespan raises urgent questions about support commitments, migration paths, and the longevity of existing Chromebook deployments. Educational institutions typically plan technology purchases on multi-year cycles, and uncertainty about platform stability could significantly impact future procurement decisions.",

      "content": "The court documents reveal that the \u201ctimeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034.\u201d In other words, Google is pulling the plug as soon as it can. As previously hinted at by a Google VP, lawyers spelled out that the lack of compatibility between most existing Chromebook hardware and \u201cAluminium OS\u201d requires Google \u201cto maintain existing ChromeOS at least through 2033 to meet its \u201810 year support commitment\u2019 to existing users.\u201d\n\nOne illustration, seen below, also describes \u201cAluminium\u201d as follows:\n\nAluminium (\u2018ChromeOS\u2019 built on the Android stack) will leverage Android\u2019s pre-existing stack. [...] The documents reveal that while Google will have a release of Android\u2019s desktop UI \u2013 known as \u201cAluminium OS\u201d \u2013 for \u201ccommercial trusted testers\u201d in 2026, a \u201cfull release\u201d isn\u2019t expected until 2028. \u201cEnterprise and education sectors\u201d would be included in the 2028 release, suggesting that the 2026 release might focus on consumers (speculation on our part, to be clear), or just not be widely sold at all to start. Given the heavy focus for ChromeOS today on enterprise and education, it makes sense to give \u201cAluminium\u201d a bit more time in the oven before replacing everything.\n\nBeyond that, ChromeOS as we know it today is dying, Google\u2019s lawyers revealed. [...] # ChromeOS will be \u2018phased out\u2019 in 2034 as Android PCs arrive late, court docs suggest\n\nAvatar for Ben Schoon\n\nNew findings in court documents shed a bit more light around Google\u2019s plans for Android\u2019s desktop UI, as well as its future plans for ChromeOS, and it might all take a bit longer than you were expecting.\n\nGoogle revealed last year that its new Android desktop experience would arrive in 2026, and it certainly seems like those plans are moving. But, in court documents surfaced by The Verge, it sounds like 2026 was just the goal, and the \u201cfull\u201d arrival might take a bit longer.",

      "title": "Google's Aluminium OS delayed to 2028, faces antitrust exemption",
      "content": "Google just pushed back the future of its laptop business by two years, and the tech giant managed to do it while securing a controversial exemption from antitrust restrictions. Court documents obtained by The Verge reveal that Project Aluminium - Google's much-hyped merger of Android and ChromeOS - won't reach consumers until 2028, contradicting public statements from executives who promised a 2026 debut. [...] The delay hits hardest in education and enterprise, the sectors where ChromeOS built its reputation. Google's court filings explicitly state these customers won't see Aluminium until 2028, not 2026. That's a problem, considering Chromebooks dominate US classrooms with roughly 50% market share. Schools that invested heavily in Google's education ecosystem now face years of uncertainty about whether their hardware will even support the transition. [...] And many devices won't make the cut. John Maletis, Google's head of ChromeOS, told Chrome Unboxed that \"not all devices will be able to migrate over to the new stack\" due to technical specifications. Google will honor its 10-year support commitment for existing Chromebooks, but that support means staying on ChromeOS, not upgrading to Aluminium. The company plans to maintain ChromeOS through 2033 specifically because existing hardware can't run the new OS.\n\nThen comes the kill date. Google's lawyers revealed the company intends to \"phase out ChromeOS\" entirely by 2034, as soon as legally permissible under various jurisdictions' device support requirements. It's a remarkably frank admission that ChromeOS is on death row, just waiting for the execution window to open.",
