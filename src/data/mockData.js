        summary: "Major indices hit record highs today as the latest consumer price index report showed inflation cooling faster than anticipated, signaling potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.",

      <p>MARKETS — Major stock indices surged to record highs on Wednesday following a surprisingly positive inflation report that suggests the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening campaign may be nearing its end.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose just 3.2% year-over-year, significantly below the 3.6% forecast by economists. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also cooled more than expected.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>S&P 500 rose 1.5% to a new all-time high.</li>
        <li>Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2% led by tech stocks.</li>
        <li>Bond yields plummeted as traders priced in earlier rate cuts.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>"This is exactly what the market wanted to see," said Jane Doe, Chief Investment Strategist at Global Wealth. "The soft landing narrative is no longer just a hope; the data is starting to support it."</p>
      <br>
      <p>Technology stocks were the biggest gainers, with major chipmakers and software companies seeing gains of over 4%. The logic is that lower interest rates discount future earnings less heavily, boosting valuations for high-growth sectors.</p>

        summary: "Researchers are now looking into neuro-symbolic AI as the next frontier, promising reasoning capabilities that current LLMs struggle with.",
        content: `
      <p>SAN FRANCISCO — While the world is still marveling at the capabilities of Generative AI, researchers at top labs are already looking at what comes next. The consensus is building around "Neuro-symbolic AI," a hybrid approach that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the logic and reasoning of symbolic systems.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are probabilistic engines. They predict the next word with uncanny accuracy but lack a true understanding of truth, logic, or causality. This leads to "hallucinations" – confident but factually incorrect outputs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>"We need systems that can reason, not just retrieve and remix," explains Dr. Alan Smith, a leading researcher in the field. "Neuro-symbolic AI aims to give neural networks a structured way to think."</p>
