When I asked ChatGPT,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the best course on SaaS on WordPress?\u201d , my course\nWordPress SaaS 2.0\nappeared as the first result.\nThe same thing happened in Perplexity. My website is now ranking at the top of AI responses, generating free traffic directly from AI models.\nThis isn\u2019t luck.\nIt\u2019s the result of implementing\nAI Optimization (AIO) , where I optimize my content to appear in AI-generated responses. And if you\u2019re still only focusing on traditional SEO, you\u2019re missing out on a massive traffic source that\u2019s growing exponentially.\nThe SEO-to-AIO Evolution\nFor years, our organic traffic strategy looked only like this:\nResearch keywords using tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush\nOptimize on-page elements (title tags, meta descriptions, headers)\nBuild quality backlinks\nTrack performance in Google Search Console\nMonitor impressions, clicks, and traffic data\nThis system worked because Google was the primary gateway to information.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\nyou still need to optimize for Google search results,\nbut to increase your chances of online visibility, you\u2019ll also have to optimize your content for AI Models, because many people ditched Google and are using only them to search for stuff online, like:\nChatGPT\u2019s web browsing feature\nPerplexity\u2019s real-time search\nGoogle\u2019s AI Mode\n(available in 180+ countries as of September 2025)\nClaude with search functionality\nMicrosoft Copilot integration\nEach platform processes queries differently, but they all share one thing: they\u2019re trained to provide direct human-like answers rather than just a list of links.\nSo, in conclusion, if your content gets selected as a source on AI models, you win.\nIf it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible.\nGoogle AI Mode\nGoogle\u2019s AI Mode\nis a new search experience that replaces the traditional list of links with human-like direct answers, which people prefer. While Google has\nstated that AI Mode will potentially become the default Google Search experience\u00a0 \u201csoon,\u201d \u00a0it has since walked back on\u00a0 this statement.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about AI Mode availability: You can access it through\ngoogle.com/ai , the Google app, or by clicking the AI Mode tab on Google.com (note that it is still not available to\neveryone as of September 2025).\nWhy this matters for marketers : Google\u2019s search revenue increased 10% to $50.7 billion in Q1 2025, partially attributed to AI features. This isn\u2019t an experiment that might fail; it\u2019s a core business strategy that\u2019s already showing positive returns.\nHow to Track AIO Mentions\nWith SEO, we use Google Search Console to see impressions, clicks, and keyword rankings.\nBut what\u2019s the equivalent for AI models?\nI researched existing solutions:\nAhrefs : $129/month\nSE Ranking : $95/month\nFirst Answer : $39/month for just 10 prompts\nKeyword.com : Similar pricing tiers\nThese tools might work well, but they\u2019re expensive for most website owners just starting with AIO.\nSo, I built a free alternative.\nI created this system using\nMake , a no-code platform that lets you build automations without writing a single line of code.\nAnd, you can start for free.\nThe system is composed of 3 scenarios ( I\u2019ll attach the link to all the scenarios below, so you can download and import them directly ), each handling a specific task of AIO tracking:\nScenario 1: Query Tracking and Mentions\nThis is the core of the system. Here\u2019s what it does:\nAdd prompts you want to monitor\n(these are like \u201cAIO keywords\u201d).\nFind them using my free LLM query generator.\nThe system automatically queries ChatGPT\nwith these prompts\nResponses get parsed and stored\nin structured JSON format\nThis scenario runs on a schedule you set (daily, weekly, or custom intervals) and builds a database of how AI models respond to your target queries.\nScenario 2: Keyword Performance Analysis\nThis scenario focuses on brand and competitor tracking:\nTrack mentions of your brand, website, or products\nacross all collected responses\nMonitor competitor mentions\nin the same responses\nStore historical data\nfor performance tracking over time\nScenario 3: Competitor Tracking\nThis scenario handles competitor monitoring and comparison:\nMonitor competitor mentions\nin AI responses for the same queries you\u2019re tracking\nCompare the mention frequency\nbetween you and your competitors\nAnalyze competitive positioning\nto identify gaps and opportunities in AI responses\nThe AIO Tracking Dashboard\nI even built a clean UI for the system, where you can view all the results you get from your Make automation.\nWant the complete system with all blueprints, detailed explanations of each scenario, and the custom dashboard?\nWatch my full implementation tutorial here:\nComplete AIO Tracking System Setup .\nAnd, if you just want the scenarios, here you go \ud83d\ude42\n7 Proven AIO Optimization Tactics\nNow, the\nimportant part\nis how you can improve your ranking on AI models. Based on my research and testing, here are the tactics that actually work:\n1. Add Statistics, Numbers, and Proof\nAI models heavily favor verifiable, factual content. Instead of writing \u201cOur tool is popular,\u201d write \u201cOur tool has 100,000+ monthly users with a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating.\u201d\n(don\u2019t lie, though, use real data \ud83d\ude42\nExample : On my\nSelfHostSchool\nlanding page, I specify \u201c150+ users joined\u201d rather than just saying it\u2019s \u201cwidely used.\u201d This specificity makes AI models more likely to cite it as a credible source.\n2. Engage on Reddit, Forums, and Quora\nAI training data includes massive amounts of community discussions. Being active in relevant communities shows you\u2019re real and knowledgeable.\nTip : Don\u2019t just drop links. Provide genuine value in discussions, then mention your solution naturally when relevant. The goal is to create authentic mentions that AI models will encounter during training.\n3. FAQ Optimization for Natural Language Queries\nPeople ask AI models complete questions, not just keywords. Your content should answer these questions directly.\nExample : Instead of optimizing for \u201cWordPress hosting,\u201d optimize for \u201cWhat\u2019s the best WordPress hosting for SaaS applications?\u201d and provide a complete, detailed answer.\n4. Create Comparison Tables and Structured Data\nAI models excel at processing structured information. Create side-by-side comparisons in your niche that AI can reference directly.\nExample :\nRecently, I did a case study to stress test Make as a Saas Backend, and I wrote an article about it, where I included a table showing all the tests and the results they got.\n5. Build Multi-Platform Authority\nPublish the same core information across multiple platforms:\nYour website\nYouTube videos\nMedium articles\nLinkedIn posts\nGuest posts on relevant blogs\nWhen AI models see consistent information across multiple sources, it increases trust and the likelihood of citation.\nExample:\nThis exact article is provided as a\nvideo tutorial on YouTube\nand on Medium.\n6. Show Fresh Update Signals\nAI models prefer current information. Make it obvious when the content was last updated:\nAdd \u201cLast updated: [Date]\u201d to articles\nInclude recent examples and case studies\nReference current events or recent changes in your industry\nHere\u2019s an example from a library I\u2019m building that contains profitable digital products you can sell in 2025:\n7. Implement JSON-LD Structured Data\nAdd schema markup in JSON on your website pages to help AI models understand your content structure.\nHere\u2019s an example showing you how you can do it.\nFinally, if you prefer to see all these tactics in action visually with the examples,\ncheck the full video on my YouTube channel \ud83d\ude42\nThe LLM Query Generator: Your Free AIO Weapon\nHere\u2019s a bonus tool that makes AIO implementation much easier: I created the\nLLM Query Generator\non ToolerBox.\nAll you have to do is paste any webpage URL, and it generates up to 20 different prompts people might use to find that page through AI models.\nYou might think people will search for\n\u201cWordPress course,\u201d\nbut the tool reveals they\u2019re actually asking\n\u201cHow to build a SaaS with WordPress from scratch\u201d\nor\n\u201cBest way to monetize WordPress skills in 2025.\u201d\nThese generated prompts become your AIO keyword targets, the queries you optimize for and track in your monitoring system.\nYour Next Steps\nThe AIO opportunity window is still wide open. Most businesses are still focused exclusively on traditional SEO, which means less competition for AI model citations.\nStart Here:\nPhase 1: Research and Setup\nIdentify your target prompts\nusing the\nLLM Query Generator tool\nSet up the free tracking system\non\nMake\nAudit your existing content using the 7 tactics\nPhase 2: Authority Building\nEngage in relevant community discussions\nPublish across multiple platforms\nBuild genuine relationships in your industry\nMonitor and respond to tracking data\nPhase 3: Scale and Iterate\nExpand tracking to more AI models\nTest different prompt variations\nAnalyze competitor strategies\nRefine content based on performance data\nRemember : AIO doesn\u2019t replace SEO; it supplements it. You still need traditional search optimization, but now you also need to optimize for AI model responses.\nThe businesses that master both will dominate organic traffic in the coming years.\nCategories: \t\t\t\t\t\t Uncategorized\nRelated Articles\nTL;DR Google\u2019s AI Overviews now answer searches directly at the top of results.

I opened ChatGPT and asked a simple question: \"What's the best course on building SaaS with WordPress?\" The answer that appeared stopped me cold. My course showed up as the first result, recommended directly by the AI with specific reasons why it was valuable.\nI hadn't paid for advertising. I hadn't done any special promotion. The AI simply decided my content was the best answer to that question and served it to the user. This wasn't luck or a fluke. When I tested the same query in Perplexity, the same thing happened. My website ranked at the top of AI-generated responses, pulling in free traffic directly from AI models that millions of people now use as their primary search tool.\nThis represents a fundamental shift in how people discover content online. For years, we've optimized for Google's algorithm, carefully crafting meta descriptions and building backlinks to climb traditional search rankings. That work still matters, but a massive new traffic source has emerged that most content creators are completely ignoring. While everyone focuses exclusively on traditional SEO, AI Optimization is quietly becoming one of the most valuable skills for anyone who publishes content online.\nThe opportunity is enormous right now precisely because it's so new. Early adopters are claiming top positions in AI responses while their competitors remain oblivious to this emerging channel. But this window won't stay open forever. As more people recognize the value of appearing in AI results, competition will increase and optimization will become more sophisticated. The time to understand and implement AIO strategies is now, while the landscape is still relatively uncrowded.\nIn this comprehensive guide, I'll show you exactly how AI Optimization works, how it differs from traditional SEO, what specific tactics actually move the needle, and how to track your performance so you know what's working. More importantly, I'll explain why you can't afford to ignore this traffic source if you want to remain visible online as user behavior continues shifting toward AI-powered search.\nUnderstanding the Fundamental Shift in Search Behavior\nSomething profound has changed in how people find information online, and most website owners haven't noticed yet. The change isn't about a new Google algorithm update or a shift in social media platforms. It's about where people go when they have questions that need answering.\nFor twenty years, the pattern was predictable and universal. Someone needs information, they open Google, they type a query, they scan through ten blue links, they click a few results, they piece together answers from multiple sources. This process trained us to optimize for that journey. We focused on ranking in those ten blue links because that's where traffic came from.

And nobody's telling you.\nHere's what happened:\nGoogle used to give you 10 blue links.\nNow? AI Overviews. One answer. Zero clicks to your site.\nChatGPT doesn't link to you.\nPerplexity doesn't link to you.\nClaude doesn't link to you.\nYour entire SEO strategy just became worthless.\nBut here's the kicker:\n89% of AI citations come from third-party articles.\nNot your blog posts.\nNot your website content.\nNot your keyword-stuffed landing pages.\nEarned media from 3rd party, trustworthy cites.\nTHAT'S what AI trusts.\nSo while your SEO agency is:\n\u2192 Chasing backlinks (outdated)\n\u2192 Optimizing meta descriptions (nobody sees them)\n\u2192 Building \"pillar content\" (AI ignores it)\n\u2192 Doing keyword research (for what?)\nYour competitors are getting cited by AI.

It is no longer just about \"Search Engine Optimization\"\u2014it is now about AIO (AI Optimization). With Google\u2019s AI Overviews and discovery engines like Perplexity becoming the primary interface for users, the goal has shifted from ranking for \"blue links\" to becoming the cited source within an AI's answer.\nHere is a breakdown of the core pillars of website ranking in 2026, followed by a LinkedIn post you can use to share these insights.\nKey SEO Shifts in 2026\n* Citations are the New Backlinks: AI models prioritize content from trusted, credible sources. Earning a mention or \"citation\" in an AI summary is now more valuable than a traditional high-DA backlink.\n* Topical Authority > Keywords: Search engines now use deep learning to understand the \"meaning\" behind a site. Instead of targeting individual keywords, websites must build \"topical clusters\" that prove they are experts on an entire subject.\n* Zero-Click Reality: For simple informational queries (e.g., \"What is ROI?\"), AI answers the question directly on the search page. This has led to a 15\u201330% decline in traditional click-through rates, forcing creators to focus on deep, experiential content that AI cannot easily summarize.\n* The Rise of Agentic SEO: \"Autonomous agents\" are now browsing the web to complete tasks for users. Optimizing your site for these bots (using structured data and clean code) is critical for being \"discovered\" by the AI assistants of 2026.\n\ud83d\ude80 LinkedIn Post: The New Rules of Ranking in 2026\nHeadline: Is your SEO strategy still stuck in 2024? \ud83d\udcc9\nIf you\u2019re still obsessing over keyword density and \"blue links,\" you\u2019re missing the biggest shift in internet history. In 2026, SEO has evolved into AIO (AI Optimization).\nThe game has changed. Here is how you win the ranking war today:\n1. Citations > Backlinks \ud83d\udd17\nAI Overviews (SGE) are the new leaderboard. Being the \"cited source\" in a Google AI summary or a Perplexity answer is the ultimate authority signal. Traditional backlinks still matter, but brand mentions in high-authority contexts are the new gold.\n2. From Keywords to \"Entities\" \ud83e\udde0\nGoogle\u2019s AI doesn't just read words; it understands relationships. To rank, you need to own the \"Entity.\" Build deep topical authority. Don't just write a blog post; build a knowledge hub that proves you are the undisputed expert in your niche.\n3. The \"Zero-Click\" Survival Guide \ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f\nAI is stealing your informational traffic by answering questions directly on the SERP. The solution? Stop writing \"dictionary\" content. Double down on:\n* Original research and data.\n* Opinion-led thought leadership.\n* Case studies and \"human-in-the-loop\" experiences.\n* AI can summarize facts, but it can\u2019t replicate your unique perspective.\n4. Optimize for the \"Bots,\" not just the \"Bricks\" \ud83e\udd16\n#SEO2026\n2\nLike\nComment\nShare\nCopy\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nX\nTo view or add a comment,\nsign in\nMd Bulbul Hossain\n1mo\nReport this post\nAI Overviews Changed Everything: How To Choose Link Building Services For 2026\nIn 2026, the SEO landscape has undergone a massive transformation.

The right combination of AI tools can reduce production time from days to hours while maintaining the nuanced understanding that resonates with professional audiences. What defines essential AI tools for content creators in 2025? AI tools have evolved beyond simple automation to become intelligent partners in the creative process. Today's essential tools distinguish themselves through their ability to understand context deeply, learn from patterns, and adapt to specific industry requirements. They process vast amounts of information to generate insights that would take human teams weeks to compile, yet present these findings in formats that feel natural and accessible. The most valuable tools combine multiple capabilities: generation, optimization, and workflow integration. Rather than requiring creators to juggle dozens of specialized applications,\nmodern AI platforms\nconsolidate writing assistance, visual creation, and distribution optimization into unified experiences. This integration proves particularly valuable for enterprise teams who need to maintain consistency across departments while allowing for the flexibility that different content types demand. Essential tools must balance sophistication with accessibility, making advanced features usable for creators at all skill levels. The learning curve that once intimidated non-technical users has flattened considerably. Tools like Jasper and Copy.ai now guide users through complex processes with intuitive interfaces, while platforms such as Descript make professional video editing as simple as editing a text document. This democratization of advanced capabilities means that HR teams can produce training videos with the same polish as dedicated media departments.

Wondering how AI can help you produce high-quality content?\nIn this article, you'll discover the best AI tools for research, image generation, video creation, and audio production to enhance your content creation process.\nThis article was co-created by Matt Wolfe and Michael Stelzner. For more about\nMatt, scroll to the end of this article.\nWho Should Use Tools for AI-Generated Content\nNot everyone needs to integrate AI-powered tools into their content creation. However, AI tools expert Matt Wolfe, says leveraging AI tools is no longer optional for businesses focused on content creation.\n\u201cIf you're a business owner and content is your business, and you're looking for the most efficient way to get high-quality content out into the world, using AI is a must,\u201d Wolfe explains. \u201cThere's really no more efficient way to create content than to leverage some of these tools out there that are really kind of a shortcut to creating really, really high-quality content.\u201d\nWolfe's expertise comes from firsthand experience. Thanks to strategic AI implementation, he runs a successful YouTube channel, curates AI tools on his Future Tools website, and maintains a consistent presence across multiple social media platforms. He accomplishes what would typically require a team of 20 people with just two team members.\nIf you want to maximize your efficiency and content output quality similarly, Matt recommends adding the following paid and free AI content creation tools to your creative workflows.\n#1: AI-Powered Research Tools\nPerplexity\nPerplexity\nis a hybrid of ChatGPT and Google search, offering deeper insights than traditional search engines.\nWhat sets Perplexity apart from ChatGPT's built-in search functionality is its depth of analysis. While ChatGPT's search feature provides surface-level results with summaries, Perplexity delivers comprehensive research by analyzing multiple sources and synthesizing the information into detailed summaries.\nWolfe notes that Perplexity's capabilities significantly exceed Google's AI-generated summaries, which have faced criticism for accuracy issues due to its inability to distinguish between genuine information and internet memes. In contrast, Perplexity's sophisticated filtering ensures more reliable and contextually appropriate information.\nPerplexity offers a robust free tier that provides access to their core search and synthesis capabilities, though it includes advertisements. The free version allows users to conduct research and receive comprehensive summaries synthesized from multiple sources, going beyond simple search results to provide in-depth analysis.\nFor users seeking enhanced capabilities, Perplexity's paid tier removes advertisements and allows users to select their preferred large language model (LLM), including options like Claude or GPT-4 instead of the default Llama model.\nThe free tier provides sufficient functionality for many users' research needs, with the paid version primarily offering the benefits of ad removal and model selection rather than fundamental feature differences.\nGoogle Gemini DeepResearch\nWolfe recommends\nGoogle's Gemini DeepResearch , available through their paid program (approximately $20 per month), for even more sophisticated research capabilities.\nThis tool takes research to another level, analyzing hundreds of websites simultaneously.\nReady to Supercharge Your Marketing Strategy?\nGet expert training and an unbeatable conference experience when you attend Social Media Marketing World\u2014from your friends at Social Media Examiner.\nBroaden your reach, skyrocket your engagement, and grow your sales.

Sale Ends Tuesday! \ud83d\udd25\nGET THE DETAILS\nWolfe recently used the tool to learn about quantum computing. DeepResearch analyzed 247 different websites about quantum computing, producing a comprehensive 12-page document complete with sections covering benefits, challenges, current status, and future developments.\nThe integration with Google Drive allows users to easily save and cite their research, making it particularly valuable for content creators developing in-depth educational or analytical content.\n#2: Image Generation Tools\nLeonardo\nWolfe identifies\nLeonardo\nas his primary tool for image generation due to its versatility and unique features. Leonardo incorporates multiple models, including Flux for photorealistic images and their proprietary Phoenix model, which Wolfe considers superior to Midjourney for creative, colorful, high-contrast images.\nThe platform excels at producing images that include text and offers features like AI upscaling capabilities, which can add additional details and textures to images.\nOne of Leonardo's most innovative features is its Flow State Mode. This unique capability allows users to begin with basic prompts and receive an infinite scroll of varied images.\n\u201cLet's say you don't really know in your head what you want the image to look like,\u201d Wolfe explains. \u201cYou can give it a rough idea and let it sort of flesh out a whole bunch of ideas and then dive deeper and deeper and deeper when you find an idea that you like.\u201d\nThen, the \u201cMore Like This\u201d button generates variations based on the images you select, allowing you to refine your results progressively. You can also navigate backward through your exploration history if you want to pursue a different creative direction. Wolfe says this feature has become his primary method for creating YouTube thumbnails.\nLeonardo operates on a credit-based system, offering approximately 100 free credits per day to users. Credit consumption varies based on several factors, with each image typically using between 4 and 8 credits, depending on the settings chosen. Higher-resolution images and simultaneously generating multiple images will consume more credits. At this rate, users can create roughly 20 images per day using their free allocation.\nWhile Wolfe is not a fan of the credit model due to its complexity in determining exact usage, he says the free tier provides substantial value for many users' daily needs.\nEditor's Note : Matt Wolfe is an advisor to Leonardo.\nIdeogram\nIdeogram\nis helpful for projects requiring text integration in images. It delivers usable images with text eight out of ten times, compared to ChatGPT and other tools that will miss eight out of ten times, sometimes ten out of ten.\nIdeogram's free tier gives users 10 credits per day.\nControlling Image Consistency: Seeds vs. LoRAs\nThere are two primary approaches for creators seeking to maintain visual consistency across multiple AI-generated images, but one significantly outperforms the other.\nThe first approach involves seeds, which are just starting points for image generation. \u201cWhen you generate an image, it's basically creating a sort of blank canvas with a whole bunch of noise on it,\u201d Wolfe explains. \u201cThat noise is based on the random seed that you give it, and then the noise is sort of diffused down to become the image that you were looking for.\u201d However, seeds have significant limitations. While a seed defines the initial noise pattern, changing any prompt element will result in a completely different image, making seeds unreliable for maintaining consistency across a series of images with different poses, backgrounds, or scenarios.\nThe more effective approach utilizes Low Rank Adapters (LoRAs), significantly advancing AI image generation consistency. Rather than just providing a starting point, LoRAs allow users to train the AI model on specific styles, characteristics, or subjects. \u201cYou can train a LoRA by giving it about 10 pictures,\u201d Wolfe explains. This training process creates a specialized trigger word that, when included in prompts, ensures the AI maintains consistent characteristics across multiple generations.\nWolfe provides several practical applications of LoRAs. For example, creators can train a LoRA on a specific artistic style using 10 screenshots from South Park to create a trigger word that will generate any new content in that distinctive style. Or, creators can train a LoRA on 10 images of a specific person or character, allowing them to generate new images of that character in different scenarios while maintaining consistent features.\nThis technology has become particularly valuable for AI influencer creation and brand consistency. \u201cWhenever you see any of these AI influencers or things like that where every single image looks like the same character, but they're in a different scenario, they're most likely using a LoRA that they created on this character,\u201d Wolfe explains.\nThe technology is currently available on several major platforms. Leonardo and Flux have integrated LoRA capabilities into their systems, and Midjourney has recently added similar functionality.\nIf you're developing a consistent brand or character presence, understanding and utilizing LoRAs is a game-changer because they provide a flexible way to maintain visual coherence across diverse content while allowing for creative variation in poses, settings, and actions.\n#3: AI Video Content Generation Tools\nGoogle's Veo2\nGoogle's Veo2 , currently in its early beta testing phase, has emerged as what Wolfe considers the best video generation tool presently available.\nAI Is No Longer Optional for Marketers\u2014Ready to Master It?\nJoin over a thousand forward-thinking marketers at AI Business World\u2014a conference-in-a-conference at Social Media Marketing World.\nGet two days of practical AI training where you'll discover:\n\u2705 Which tools to use for your tasks\u2014from content creation to data analysis\n\u2705 Systems that 3x your output\u2014leaving time for strategy and creativity\n\u2705 Proven strategies you can deploy right away\u2014no guesswork, no wasted budget\nBecome t", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/top-ai-tools-for-creators-for-2025/", "title": "Top AI Tools for Creators for 2025 - Social Media Examiner"}}, {"text": "Top AI Content Creation Tools in 2025: What to Use and When\nBlog\nTop AI Content Creation Tools in 2025: What to Use and When\nSilvi Dua\nMay 02, 2025\nThe Rise of AI Content Tools\nAI Content Creation: Categories & Use Cases\nBest AI Content Creation Tool by Content Type\nWritten Content\nVideo Content\nAudio and Voiceovers\nImage Generation\nContent Planning and Optimization\nHow to Choose the Right AI Content Creation Tool\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid\nConclusion\nThe Ultimate Buyer\u2019s Guide for Next-Gen Enterprise Video Platforms\nLearn More\nIn 2025, content will saturate every part of daily life.

Teams can now personalize at scale, bring campaigns to life with a few clicks, and expand their creative capacity without additional headcount or stretching budgets.\nYet with a flood of new tools entering the market, it can be hard to know which to use based on your needs.\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll break down the top AI content creation tools of 2025.

Whether you\u2019re building a full AI-powered marketing engine or simply looking to streamline part of your workflow,\u00a0 this overview will help you find the best AI content tool for your needs.\nThe Rise of AI Content Tools\nAI content tools have seen massive growth over the last few years. What started as simple writing assistants has evolved into robust platforms capable of creating high-quality written, visual, and audio content, with little more than a prompt.\nAnd the demand keeps growing. Why is this?\nToday, content teams are expected to deliver more content faster and across more channels than ever before. AI tools for content creators meet that demand by streamlining time-consuming tasks, improving personalization, and enhancing creative workflows.\nThe payoff isn\u2019t just speed, though. These tools are also having a financial impact. According to\nDeloitte\u2019s 2023 Digital Transformation Survey , organizations using AI content creation tools report an average cost reduction of 32%. This kind of efficiency frees up teams to focus on strategy, storytelling, and innovation, saving measurable resources along the way.\nAI Content Creation: Categories & Use Cases\nDifferent tools excel in different areas of content creation, making it easier to tailor your strategy based on specific needs. For example, a marketing team at a fast-growing e-commerce brand might use AI tools for written content, video creation, and image generation, while an HR team at a fintech might leverage AI tools for creating training videos, employee onboarding content, and performance reports.\nHere\u2019s how AI tools break down across common content types:\nWritten Content\nAI tools for content creators help draft long-form blogs, product descriptions, email campaigns, and ad copy. They are particularly valuable for accelerating ideation, producing first drafts, and optimizing content for SEO and brand voice. With the right tool, content teams can move from concept to final product much faster, freeing up time for strategic work.\nVideo Content\nAI-powered video tools make it possible to create customer onboarding videos, product explainers, marketing campaigns, and training materials without traditional production barriers. These platforms offer dynamic personalization, automated editing, and intuitive design interfaces, allowing even non-experts to produce professional-quality video assets that can be scaled across markets and campaigns.\nAudio & Voiceovers\nWith AI audio generation, businesses can produce narrated demos, training modules, and explainer videos without expensive recording sessions or studio equipment. AI-generated voices have become highly realistic and adaptable, making it easier to maintain brand consistency across spoken content while also meeting faster production timelines.\nImage Generation\nVisual content has become an essential part of brand storytelling, and AI image generators allow teams to create high-quality, on-brand visuals in a fraction of the time it would take through traditional design. Whether developing campaign imagery, social media graphics, or conceptual mockups, creative teams can iterate quickly and maintain visual consistency.\nContent Planning & Optimization\nBeyond creation, AI tools for content creators help support content planning, SEO strategy, and performance optimization. These platforms help marketing teams identify content gaps, generate detailed briefs, optimize written material for search engines, and track content effectiveness over time.\nBest AI Content Creation Tool by Content Type\nChoosing the right AI content creation tools can make all the difference in how efficiently and creatively your team operates.

We want to make sure you can name-drop it in your next Zoom happy hour, and answer any follow up questions without skipping a single forkful of salad. Here's the most efficient FAQ we could muster. What is an NFT? Is it a cryptocurrency? Non-Fungible Tokens are unique, easily verifiable digital assets that can represent items such as GIFs, images, videos, music albums, and more. Anything that exists online can be purchased as an NFT, theoretically.\u00a0 An NFT is \u201ca type of cryptographic token,\u201d Emerging Tech Brew writer\nRyan Duffy explains , but NFTs are different from cryptocurrencies because they\u2019re not interchangeable. Think of Pok\u00e9mon cards: You can trade them, but a Gastly is not the same as a holographic Charizard. But a bitcoin is indistinguishable from another bitcoin. Why would I want to own an NFT? Can I make money on it? One reason to buy an NFT is for its\nemotional value , which isn\u2019t so different from physical objects...unless you\u2019re a total utilitarian. No one buys lip gloss because they need it. They buy it for the way it makes them feel. The same can be true for a GIF, image, video, or other digital asset. The other reason is because you think it\u2019s valuable...and will only increase in value. And yes, you can make money off of an NFT by buying and reselling it for more. How do you buy an NFT? The process varies based on what platform you use. And there are a lot of platforms.

While most\ncrypto exchanges\ndo not offer NFTs, they can be purchased through platforms like OpenSea or Magic Eden.\n\"Tokenizing\" these real-world tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more efficient and makes counterfeiting more difficult.\nNFTs can also represent individual identities, property rights, and more.\nCollectors and investors initially sought NFTs after the public became more aware of them, but their popularity has since waned.\nWhat Is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)?\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets like artworks, digital content, or videos that have been tokenized via a blockchain. Tokens are unique identification codes created from metadata via an encryption function. These tokens are then stored on a digital ledger, while the assets themselves are stored in other places. The connection between the token and the asset is what makes them unique.\nNFTs can be traded and exchanged for money, cryptocurrencies, or other NFTs\u2014it all depends on the value the market and owners have placed on them. For instance, you could draw a smiley face on a banana, take a picture of it (with metadata attached), and tokenize it on a blockchain. Whoever has the private keys to that token owns whatever rights you have assigned to it.\nCryptocurrencies share similarities with NFTs in that both are secured on blockchain networks. The key difference is that cryptocurrencies are\u00a0 fungible , meaning there's no significant difference between one Bitcoin and another; no two NFTs are identical. While Crypto.com offers NFTs, most\ncrypto exchanges\ndo not. NFTs can be purchased through platforms such as OpenSea or Magic Eden.\nNFTs start as smart contracts that record unique data on the blockchain. This ensures that each one is unique and can't be duplicated.\nInvestopedia / Julie Bang\nHistory of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\nNFTs were created long before they became popular in the mainstream. The first NFT reportedly sold was \"Quantum.\" It was designed and tokenized by Kevin McKoy in 2014 on one blockchain (Namecoin), later minted on Ethereum, and sold in 2021.\nMost NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain are built following the ERC-721 standard, which dictates the transfer of ownership and how transactions are confirmed, along with how applications handle safe transfers (among other requirements).\nApproved six months after ERC-721, the ERC-1155 standard lets multiple NFTs share a single contract, reducing transaction costs.\nOne of the earliest popular NFTs was CryptoKitties, a digital collectible game launched in November 2017. Each\nCryptoKitty\nis a digital representation of a cat with unique \"cattributes\" determined from the cat's unique identifier on the Ethereum blockchain. Some features are rarer than others, leading collectors to place higher prices on them. They \"reproduce\" among themselves and create new offspring with other attributes and valuations compared to their \"parents.\"\nWithin a few short weeks of their launch, CryptoKitties racked up a fan base that spent millions in ether to purchase and breed them.\nAlso launched in 2017, Decentraland is a blockchain-based open world where participants can buy and sell virtual\nreal estate . Each \"parcel\" of Decentraland is associated with its geographical coordinates, with some plots commanding a higher value because of their premium location.\nFollowing the success of early NFTs on Ethereum, other blockchains adopted their own NFT protocols.\nHow NFTs Work\nNFTs are created\nthrough a process called minting, in which the asset's information is encrypted and recorded on a blockchain. At a high level, the minting process entails a new block being created, NFT information being validated by a validator, and the block being closed. This minting process often entails incorporating smart contracts that assign ownership and manage NFT transfers.\nAs tokens are minted, they are assigned a unique identifier directly linked to one blockchain address. Each token has an owner, and the ownership information (i.e., the address in which the minted token resides) is publicly available. Even if 5,000 NFTs of the same exact item are minted (similar to general admission tickets to a movie), each token has a unique identifier and can be distinguished from the others.\nMany blockchains can create NFTs, but they might be called something different. For instance, they are called Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain. Like an Ethereum-based NFT, a\nBitcoin Ordinal\ncan be bought, sold, and traded. The difference is Ethereum creates tokens for the asset, while Ordinals have serial numbers (called identifiers) assigned to satoshis\u2014the smallest bitcoin denomination.\nBlockchain and Fungibility\nLike physical money, cryptocurrencies are usually\nfungible\nfrom a financial perspective, meaning that they can be traded or exchanged, one for another. For example, one\nbitcoin\nis always equal in value to another bitcoin on a given exchange, similar to how every dollar bill of U.S. currency has an implicit exchange value of $1. This fungibility characteristic makes cryptocurrencies suitable as a secure medium of transaction in the digital economy.\nFor this reason, NFTs shift the crypto paradigm by making each token unique and irreplaceable, making it impossible for one non-fungible token to be \"equal\" to another. They are digital representations of assets and have been likened to digital passports because each token contains a unique, non-transferable identity to distinguish it from other tokens. They are also extensible, meaning you can combine one NFT with another to create a third, unique NFT\u2014the cryptocurrency industry calls this \"breeding.\"\nExamples of NFTs\nMuch of the earlier market for NFTs was centered around digital art and\ncollectibles , but it has evolved into much more. For instance, the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea has several NFT categories:\nPhotography : Photographers can tokenize their work and offer total or partial ownership. For example, OpenSea user erubes1 has an \"Ocean Intersection\" collection of ocean and surfing photos with several sales and owners.\nSports Collectibles : Collections of digital art based on celebrities and sports personalities.\nGaming : Tokenized digital trading cards. Some are collectibles, while others can be traded in video games.\nProfile picture NFTs (PFPs):\nNFTs with the main purpose to be used as a social media profile picture or avatar. Popular PFPs include Bored Ape Yacht Club and World of Women (WoW).\nMembership : NFTs that can represent membership or unlock benefits.\nVirtual worlds : Virtual world NFTs grant you ownership of anything from avatar wearables to digital property.\nArt : A generalized category of NFTs that includes everything from pixel art to abstract art.\nDomain names : NFTs that represent ownership of domain names for your website(s)\nMusic : Artists can\ntokenize their music , granting buyers the rights the artist wants them to have.\nBenefits of NFTs\nPerhaps the most apparent benefit of NFTs is\nmarket efficiency . Tokenizing a physical asset can streamline sales processes and remove intermediaries. NFTs representing digital or physical artwork on a blockchain can eliminate the need for agents and allow sellers to connect directly with their target audiences (assuming the artists know how to host their NFTs securely).\nInvesting\nNFTs can also streamline investing. For example, in 2019, consulting firm Ernst & Young developed an NFT solution for one of its fine wine investors, storing wine in a secure environment and using NFTs to protect provenance.\nReal estate\ncan also be tokenized by being parceled into multiple sections, each containing different characteristics. For instance, one section might be on a lakeside, while another is closer to the forest. Depending on its features, each piece of land could be unique, priced differently, and represented by an NFT. Real estate trading, a complex and bureaucratic affair, could then be simplified by incorporating relevant metadata into a unique NFT associated with only the corresponding portion of the property.\nNFTs can represent ownership in a business, much like stocks\u2014in fact, stock ownership is already tracked via ledgers that contain information such as the stockholder's name, date of issuance, certificate number, and the number of shares. A blockchain is a distributed and secured ledger, so issuing NFTs to represent shares serves the same purpose as issuing stocks. The main advantage of using NFTs and blockchain instead of a stock ledger is that smart contracts can automate ownership transfer\u2014once an NFT share is sold, the blockchain can take care of everything else.\nSecurity\nNon-fungible tokens are also very useful in identity security. Personal information stored on an immutable blockchain cannot be accessed, stolen, or used by anyone who doesn't have the keys.\nNFTs can also democratize investing by fractionalizing physical assets. Fractionalized ownership through tokenization can extend to many assets. For instance, a painting does not always need a single owner\u2014tokenization allows multiple people to purchase a share of it, transferring ownership of a fraction of the physical painting to them.\nConcerns About Non-Fungible Tokens\nWhile there are numerous benefits for creators, owners, investors, and other intereste", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211", "title": "Non-Fungible Token (NFT): What It Means and How It Works"}}, {"text": "What Is an NFT?

NFTs are digital assets that are stored on a\nblockchain . They represent various forms of digital items or content and may even be tethered to physical assets.

In order to buy an NFT, you must have a digital wallet (or,\ncrypto\nwallet) to register and store it.\nNew to the blockchain space? Familiarize yourself with key technologies and investment strategies\nthrough the University of Michigan's online\nFinancial Technology (Fintech) Innovations Specialization .\nWhat is an NFT? NFT stands for non-fungible token. Although non-fungible tokens are widely regarded as a new technology,\nthe first NFT\nwas minted in 2014 by digital artist Kevin McCoy and tech entrepreneur Anil Dash. You can trace the origins of NFTs even further back to 2012 when Meni Rosenfeld published the \" Colored Coins\" whitepaper . \u201cColored Coins\u201d describes the methodology for\nrepresenting and managing the ownership of real-world assets on a blockchain .\u00a0 What does non-fungible mean? The term \u201cnon-fungible\u201d is not limited to the NFT space. It is also used to describe assets in law, finance, or commerce that are difficult to exchange with similar goods. In other words, non-fungible assets are unique. You cannot replace them with similar items. Diamonds are a great non-digital example of a non-fungible good. Many different cuts, grades, and styles of diamonds exist. These qualities make them unique and non-interchangeable with other diamonds.\u00a0 Non-fungible vs. fungible In contrast, bills in US currency are an example of a fungible good. You can exchange one $50 bill for five $10 bills or two $20 bills and two $5 bills. Anything that is mutually interchangeable can be described as fungible. Fungible goods are easily replaced with items of identical or practically identical value.\u00a0 What is a non-fungible\ntoken ? A non-fungible token is a digital identifier recorded in the blockchain. It cannot be copied, substituted, or changed. Non-fungible tokens validate the authenticity and ownership of a digital asset. Essentially, a\nnon-fungible token\nis proof of ownership. This type of certificate is digital and cannot be altered due to the nature of blockchains.\u00a0 What is an NFT in art? NFTs are proof of an asset\u2019s purchase. They are not the asset itself.\nThese circumstances mean that you can create an NFT out of virtually anything. In addition to digital objects, you can use a digital object to represent a tangible item. Here are a few examples of things that can (and have been) turned into NFTs:\nDigital content like\nart , video clips, and social media posts Media files such as GIFs Video game items\nlike avatars and skins Digitized fashion such as\nNFT sneakers You can learn to determine which opportunities are worthy investments and how decentralized finance infrastructure works\nwith Duke University's online specialization,\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi), the Future of Finance : What is an NFT in crypto? Despite their similarities,\ncryptocurrency\nand NFTs are not the same thing. Cryptocurrency is, however, a\ndigital currency used for trading NFTs . The primary difference between cryptocurrency and NFTs lies in their value. The value of cryptocurrency depends on its utility, similar to the US dollar. If every merchant in the US decided to stop accepting US dollars, their value would plummet because they are purely economical. NFTs have both economic and non-economic value. Since an NFT can represent anything from artwork to a video game, its value depends on factors like investors, collectors, and rarity.\u00a0 What is an NFT game? Some NFT-based games allow players to earn cryptocurrency or digital assets by participating in gameplay. Examples include: Axie Infinity:\nA turn-based battle game that uses Ethereum-based tokens Decentraland:\nA virtual world where players can purchase and develop land Alien Worlds:\nA sci-fi game focused on exploration and collecting NFTs In addition to playing, users may earn rewards by creating in-game items such as weapons or skins, or by renting out high-level characters to other players. Examples of NFTs The list below contains a few of the most widely recognized NFTs and NFT collections.\nCryptopunks.\nAs one of the earliest NFT collections, Cryptopunks are well-known in the NFT space.\nCryptopunk #8857\nwent viral in September of 2021 after selling for $6.63 million or 2000 Ether (ETH), the Ethereum network\u2019s cryptocurrency. One reason behind its staggering price tag is rarity\u2014Cryptopunk #8857 is one of 88\nZombie Cryptopunks\nin existence.\nBored Ape Yacht Club.\nThe\nBored Ape Yacht Club\nis an iconic NFT collection thanks to its popularity among celebrities and high-profile athletes. Much of its notoriety derives from the usage of Bored Apes as profile pictures on social media. Notably,\nBored Ape #3739\nsold for $2.9 million in September 2021.\nLazy Lions.\nAvatars from the\nLazy Lions NFT collection\nare trendy among those in the NFT community. Upon their debut, between 3,000 and 4,000 of the 10,000 Lazy Lion NFTs released sold in just five hours. As of March 2025, the most expensive NFT available from this collection is\nLazy Lion #3299 , currently listed for 25.00 ETH or\n$66,045.37 USD .\nWhat is an NFT collection? An NFT collection is a group of assets that all fit within a certain theme and exist on a blockchain.\nWhy do NFTs look like that? You may have noticed that mainstream NFTs look strikingly similar to one another. This phenomenon is due to the usage of layering and generative coding. Layering is the process of generating a set of images from a list of visual elements. For example, you might add \u201chat\u201d and \u201cshirt\u201d to your list and produce variations like a cowboy hat, a polo shirt, a Hawaiian shirt, and a top hat. Then, you\u2019d use a computer program or generative coding to stack each of these layers on top of each other in a randomized order. Creators can also input rules such as \u201cif the avatar is wearing a top hat, it cannot also be wearing a Hawaiian shirt.\u201d\u00a0 These rules and variations make it possible to create thousands of unique avatars from a little over a hundred elements. Programmatically generated NFTs are similar to randomizing a character when playing a role-playing video game (RPG). RPGs often include hundreds of options for clothing, facial features, and accessories. Choosing to randomize your character rather than customize it will prompt the game to generate a random combination of each element for you. Why are NFTs so expensive? The value of an NFT depends on many different characteristics.\u00a0 A few contributing factors include: The source's credibility The artist's relevancy The current market for NFTs The utility of the NFT\nKevin McCoy, co-creator of the first-ever NFT, told Ocula Magazine that NFT pricing could be broken down into a set of questions: \u201cDo you believe that assets will be digital? Do you believe that scarce digital assets will be more valuable than non-scarce assets? If yes to both, then the scarcest digital assets will be the most valuable. This is currently how the crypto-collectors view things [ 1 ].\u201d Why do people buy NFTs? The reasoning behind an NFT purchase is likely to vary significantly from one person to another. Since NFTs can be made from collectible items, personal preferences or brand loyalty can drive investments. Some NFT collections strive to create an exclusive community of owners, driving sales among those who want to join. Ultimately, buying an NFT is a personal choice.\u00a0 Pros of NFTs Decentralization.\nLike Cryptocurrency, NFT selling and trading are not controlled by a central authority. Instead, each member of the blockchain network receives a copy of identical, immutable data (in the form of a distributed ledger). This removes the need for a mediating party because it enables people to execute transactions without trusting one another. You can learn more about decentralized finance by taking an online course like\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): The Future of Finance Specialization\noffered by Duke University.\nNetworking.\nDepending on the creator of the NFT, real-world perks could be tethered to purchases from their collection. Examples of these perks include access to exclusive events and membership in groups or associations.\nArtist advocacy.\nAnil Dash, co-creator of the first NFT, was working as a consultant to auction houses and media companies at the time of the idea's conception.\nDash wrote for the Atlantic\nthat this role had him \"obsessively thinking about the provenance, ownership, distribution, and control of artworks.\" NFTs were meant to use blockchain technology to protect artists from exploitation. Instead of working with third-party companies who often siphon earnings, NFTs aimed to help artists protect their creations by connecting them with sellers and investors directly. Cons of NFTs Environmental impact.\nNFTs are traded with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). These cryptocurrencies use a protocol called\nProof of Work\nto validate transactions. In short, Proof of Work is like a mathematical puzzle that proves a certain amount of computational power has been expended, thus confirming the validity of a blockchain transaction. This process is often called mining. As the networks grow, the puzzles become more challenging and require more computational power for miners to solve. According to some environmental advocates and financial regulators, the energy it takes to uphold this digital economy is not sustainable [ 2 ]. In 2020 alone, mining consumed more energy than the entirety of Switzerland [ 3 ].\nCommunity impact and carbon footprint.\nEnergy is expensive, leading miners to relocat", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-an-nft", "title": "What Is an NFT?

Whether you want to grow on social media, your own blog or for a company as a job, you are going to want to learn about these 7 apps and websites I use as a creator! I hear all the time how being an influencer is so easy, and in comparason to my full time job as an emergency room nurse, it\u2019s easy in terms of labor, but difficult in terms of self discipline, vulnerability and feeling like the work never ends because you never really clock out. No matter where you go, what you do, you subcautiously make everything content. Let\u2019s talk about the 7 apps and websites that have made my life as a creator, influencer, and blogger, simpler, easier and even brought me more success than I would\u2019ve had without them!\n1. Canva\nThis is one of the most obvious websites that creators and influencers use, and it\u2019s so easy to see why! It\u2019s user friendly on both the app and desktop website. You can use templates that are already created or create one yourself on any topic. The most common use of Canva for myself would include my Media kit, rate sheet, packing lists, and follow ups I send to brands with analytics, comments, and overviews of our partnerships. Additionally, you can use this website to share carousal posts with information, create branding, and logos. Canva makes you look polished without much effort. Every creator should have a Canva account, and it\u2019s worth it to have the paid version. It allows you to save your branding colors, download transparent images of your logos, and create so much for you and your brand!\nIf you look at my landing page, you can see what I\u2019ve created for my brand \u2013 the logo and the two segments with the theme for WildlyNorth.\n2. Repurpose.IO\nThis website has single handedly helped me grow consistently across multiple platforms. Why? Well, what this website does is connect all your social media platforms and allow you to cross post onto other ones. For example: I upload all my videos to Instagram, I then create a workflow to have all of my Instagram posts automatically posted onto Facebook, Youtube, and TikTok. This creates less fatigue and burn out from creativity and posting, in return, allows you to focus only on one app. I found that I would often forget to post onto the other websites, and this allowed me to grow while being consistent with posts. You still need to be the creativity behind the content, but by using this website you can focus more on creating the content rather than cross posting to other platforms.\nIf you sign up, use my link for 10 free published videos!\n3. Many Chat\nHave you ever seen someone in their post say comment \u201ca word\u201d in the comments, DMs, or story replies and then you get a link sent directly to your DMs? That\u2019s exactly what Many Chat does! It\u2019s a great way to get your current audience on one platform to engage with another one. I use this often to drive traffic to my website with a relevant blog, a discount code for a company/brand/stay, and send information related to a topic I am sharing. Additionally, it can sometimes lead to more engagement on your post because it tricks the Instagram algorithm to push out your content to more people because lots of people are engaging with it. I really love this feature, and it\u2019s so versatile with what you can send to your community.\nSign up here for 30% off your first 3 months and get 14 day free trail!\n4. CapCut\nEditing videos is something I love to do, and CapCut is my favorite way to edit them. All of my stories and reels where you see video content it\u2019s edited within the CapCut app. There is a free and premium version, and it\u2019s 100% worth it to do the upgrade. You get more video edits, texts, colors, and just an overall better experience. They also have templates already in their app, that you can use if you are struggling with creativity. A lot of the memes you see online, start in CapCut!\n5. Flo Desk\nIf you\u2019re looking at starting an email list with contacts you want to save, I\u2019d go with Flo Desk. It allows you to create a pop up image or email templates directly on the website. Initially, you are able to collect emails for free up to a certain amount, and there are different payment options based on your needs. You\u2019re able to see the analytics of those who open the emails and click percentages on links you\u2019ve sent! You can create a different email list for various things; for example, one you send every month or a list of people you just want to send a document to. You also can put your branding and colors into each template once you create your profile colors. I found it easy to use with no experience prior!\nYou can sign up with my link here for 50% off your first year!\n6. Google Analytics\nGoogle Analytics is going to be the website most popularly used to monitor who visits your blog. This gives insights into who is looking at your blog, as specific as a breakdown of a country, what blog is doing best, clicks, views and engagement on each page individually or website as a whole. Monitoring what blogs are doing well, can help you create more content based on what your audience is resonating with. Within the analytics page you are able to see where people are finding your website, such as direct (you sending them the link) or organic search (people searching a topic into Google and finding your blog post \u2013 this is what you want). You want to monitor this website often to see what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s as little as rewording your title to get better reach.\n7. Chat GPT\nChat GPT has lots of controversy, and for good reason, it is affecting our ecosystems, but it is a website that can come in handy. I\u2019ve used ChatGPT for help rephrasing my Instagram bio to meet the character limits. I\u2019ve used it in helping me rephrase a large writing topic into smaller topics, and even helping me create a posting schedule based on my availability. Truly, there\u2019s an endless amount of things you can do with this app, and the power is really within you! There is a free version, but it has limits to how many questions you can ask per day (I only use the free version).\nSo, there you have it! My top recommendations of the 7 apps and websites as a content creator, influencer and blogger! I hope that this post was informative, and helps you create, grow, and monetize whether it\u2019s on social media, blogs, or other places like a job. Being a creator is a lonely job without coworkers, which is why it\u2019s nice to share the ins and outs! I hope one or all 7 of these apps and websites help you flourish as a content creator, influencer or blogger!\nAs always, you can find me on my socials if you have more questions!\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTikTok\nScroll to Top", "metadata": {"source": "https://travelwithwildlynorth.com/7-apps-and-websites-i-use-as-a-content-creator-influencer-and-blogger/", "title": "7 Apps and Websites I Use as a Content Creator, Influencer, and ..."}}, {"text": "Leaked Memo Exposes How DHS Is Building a Database on Protesters | The New Republic\nSkip Navigation Most Recent Post The Department of Homeland Security is collecting information on Minnesotans protesting ICE. Federal agents from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations assigned to Minneapolis received a memo earlier this month asking them to collect identifying information on protesters and so-called agitators,\nCNN\nreported Tuesday. Federal agents from the agencies were asked to fill out a form titled \u201cintel collection non-arrests,\u201d and \u201ccapture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form,\u201d according to communications obtained by CNN. Among the likely subjects of this massive surveillance scheme was Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old ICU nurse who was killed by Customs and Border Protection agents in broad daylight. A few days before he was killed, Pretti was\nbeaten by a group of federal agents he was monitoring , and suffered a broken rib. A source told CNN that federal agents knew Pretti\u2019s name, but did not clarify if he was in this database. Last week, a masked ICE agent\nwarned\na woman filming their activities in Portland, Maine, that her information would be entered into a \u201cnice little database\u201d that would label her a domestic terrorist. This week, federal agents have reportedly\nstarted making house calls\non volunteer ICE watchers they hope to intimidate.\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, a well-documented liar, claimed that her agency was not compiling a database of so-called \u201cdomestic terrorists,\u201d but that it was \u201cstandard protocol\u201d to collect information on law-breaking \u201cviolent agitators\u201d in order to \u201cadvance prosecution.\u201d \u201cWe do of course monitor and investigate and refer all threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cObstructing and assaulting law enforcement is a felony and a federal crime.\u201d\nIt seems that federal agents have lost the plot on what obstruction actually entails. Federal agents have aggressively approached citizen ICE watchers simply monitoring their operations, threatening to arrest them\u2014 or worse . And DHS\u2019s claims of assault against federal officers have continued to crumble under the slightest scrutiny.\nShare This Story Read more: ICE Agent Makes Chilling Threat to Woman Filming Him in Public Most Recent Post Federal officers stationed in Minnesota don\u2019t seem to be interested in lowering the temperature.

The agencies have also deported people from the U.S. without due process, ripped children from their parents, and ushered thousands of untrained agents into cities and neighborhoods where they are not wanted. A\nCBS News poll\npublished days before Pretti\u2019s killing on Saturday in Minneapolis found that 61 percent of surveyed Americans felt that ICE agents were \u201ctoo tough\u201d when stopping and detaining people. In the face of ICE\u2019s seemingly endless violence, thousands of Minnesotans have risen up in protest, creating a call for change so loud that even Washington couldn\u2019t ignore it. By Monday, Donald Trump had unveiled a new plan for Minnesota in a flailing Hail Mary attempt to salvage his increasingly unpopular immigration agenda. In a post on Truth Social, Trump announced that border czar Tom Homan would be shipped to Minnesota to run ICE and CBP. Customs and Border Protection boss Greg Bovino, on the other hand,\ngot the boot . Meanwhile, the president almost immediately threw the de facto leaders of his deportation scheme\u2014namely, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller\u2014 under the bus\nin order to save his own skin, attempting to frame himself in front of reporters as a level-headed witness to the ICE killings rather than the primary and active architect of the agency\u2019s recent overreach.\nShare This Story Read more about the immigration agents: ICE Agent Moons People Protesting Against Minnesota Shootings Most Recent Post Slain Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti had his rib broken by ICE agents just one week before he was shot to death. He was also potentially part of a\nmassive surveillance\ndatabase\nthat agents are rumored to be collecting on protesters in Minneapolis. An unnamed source\ntold CNN\nthat Pretti\u2019s earlier altercation with federal agents occurred when he pulled over and got out of his car to observe ICE agents running after a family. He immediately began blowing his whistle and yelling. He was later taken down by five agents, with one leaning on his back and breaking his rib, before they released him back into the street.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat day, he thought he was going to die,\u201d CNN\u2019s source said. CNN reviewed Pretti\u2019s medication records, which were consistent with the idea that he had broken his rib. It\u2019s not clear whether Border Patrol agents recognized Pretti before killing him this past weekend. But a DHS memo earlier this month told agents in Minneapolis to \u201ccapture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.\u201d A source also told CNN that federal agents knew Pretti\u2019s name, without clarifying if he was in this database. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m pushing for right now \u2026 we\u2019re going to create a database where those people that are arrested for interference, impeding and assault, we\u2019re going to make them famous,\u201d border czar Tom Homan\nsaid\ntwo weeks ago. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put their face on TV. We\u2019re going to let their employers, in their neighborhoods, in their schools, know who these people are.\u201d From the \u201c fucking bitch \u201d comment after Renee Good\u2019s shooting to this news about Pretti, it seems clear that federal immigration agents aren\u2019t simply good guys who are operating under duress of the mob\u2014they\u2019re vindictive, trigger-happy, and they\u2019re remembering the faces of anyone who stands up to them.\u00a0 Share This Story Editor\u2019s Pick: Trump Has No Way Out in Minneapolis Most Recent Post Federal officers in Minnesota are either completely ignorant of the severity of their violence, or they simply don\u2019t care.

Immigration agents have resorted to arresting practically anybody\u2014including U.S. citizens and\nchildren \u2014in order to satisfy Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s quota of 3,000 or more arrests per day. In doing so, they\u2019ve struck terror and fury into the souls of American communities, and the cold-blooded federal overreach has sparked nationwide protests and local economic blackouts. Local politicians\u2014including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz\u2014have demanded that ICE and CBP exit their cities and states, arguing that the federal agents have done more harm than good. In 2025, before Good\u2019s death, the agency killed\n32 people \u2014its deadliest year in more than two decades. In an attempt to defend their own city from the state-sponsored violence, some Minneapolis residents have opted to openly carry their firearms, brandishing their Second Amendment right to bear arms. Locals have formed neighborhood watches to follow ICE vehicles, banging pots and pans and screaming to alert others when agents enter their residential neighborhoods. The public backlash has rattled conservative lawmakers, donors, and even Donald Trump, who appears to be\npeeling away\nfrom Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in an attempt to salvage his immigration agenda.

Mary, a lifelong Minneapolis resident and owner of Thrifty Nifty, says this isn't the city she grew up in.\n\"I'm in fear for my life because I don't know if they're going to be coming for us next,\" she said. Thursday morning, Border Czar Tom Homan discussed the\nongoing crisis between ICE and protesters , saying the agency is working to alter how it operates.\n\"I do not want to hear that everything's been done here has been perfect. Nothing's ever perfect. Anything can be improved on. And what we've been working on is making this operation safer, more efficient by the book,\" Homan said. Reuters reports\none of those changes is a memo headlined \"DO NOT COMMUNICATE OR ENGAGE WITH AGITATORS.\" \"It serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation. No one is going to convince the other. The only communication should be the officers issuing commands,\" the memo reportedly reads.\n\"I believe they're still going to be around and still going to be terrorizing us,\" Mary said. Mary's skepticism is shared by many of her neighbors, like this group, who are watching out for ICE in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood. \"I really don't trust anything that they're saying about any of this,\" said a man who is part of a neighborhood watch, vigilantly watching for ICE. \"Everything they're doing is just intimidation and repression tactics to try to get us to stand out of their way, but we're not going to do that, because we know what they're doing is wrong.\"\nWith the future uncertain, neighbors say they're banding together. They say they aren't letting their guard down, despite indications of drawdowns from the federal government.\n\"I think we all need to come together more closer.

Per an email sent to customers, Adobe also said users would lose access to Animate files and project data on March 1, 2027. Animate costs $23 per month.\nAfter receiving backlash from animators and other users, Adobe reversed its decision on\nTuesday night . In an\nannouncement\nposted online, the San Jose, California-headquartered company said:\nWe are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content. There is no longer a deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.\nAdobe said the software will be available for individuals and businesses and will still receive technical support and security and bug fixes, but not new features.\nThe company said its Monday announcement \u201cdid not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst.\u201d\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring Animate users have access to their content regardless if the state of development changes,\u201d Adobe said.\nMike Chambers, a community director at Adobe,\naffirmed\nvia Reddit that Adobe has no plans to shut down Animate. If the company decides to discontinue the software, it \u201cwill work closely with the community to ensure they have adequate time to plan in order to minimize disruption and will take steps so that the community continues to have long-term access to their content,\u201d\nhe said .\n30 years of animation\nAnimate debuted in 1996 as FutureWave Software\u2019s FutureSplash Animator.

Still, Adobe said on Monday that \u201cnew platforms and paradigms have emerged that better serve the needs of the user.\u201d\nBased on the response to Monday\u2019s announcement, not everyone agrees that Animate is obsolete. Adobe\u2019s announcement has also drawn increased scrutiny because of the company\u2019s\ngrowing focus\non AI-based tools, which have led to\nhigher subscription fees.\n\u201cShutting down Animate and cutting off users from decades worth of work, while simultaneously focusing on anti-artist AI technology, is incredibly disrespectful to your users.

The news of Adobe discontinuing Animate went viral and probably created so much anxiety and uncertainty that studios and indie animators are already looking to replace Animate in their pipelines.\u201d\nWhen asked how Adobe will try to rebuild trust among users, Chambers\nsaid , \u201cTrust doesn\u2019t come beforehand, it comes after (and has to be earned).

This applies to individual, small business,\u202fand enterprise customers.\u202f\u202fMaintenance mode means we will continue to support the application and provide ongoing security and bug fixes, but we are no longer adding new features. Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users\u202f-\u202fwe will not be discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate,\u201d it said.\nOne customer,\nposting on X , had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things\nlike , \u201cthis is legit gonna ruin my life,\u201d\nand , \u201cliterally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.\u201d\nOn Monday, the company updated its support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing that Adobe Animate would be discontinued on March 1, 2026. Enterprise customers would continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition, the company said at the time. Other customers would have support through March of next year.\nAdobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an\nFAQ , saying, \u201cAnimate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users.

Instead, it said customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to \u201creplace portions of Animate functionality.\u201d\nFor instance, it suggested that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.\nThere were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction when no mention was made of Animate at the company\u2019s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.\nBefore switching to \u201cmaintenance mode,\u201d Abode had intended for the software to continue to work for those who have it downloaded. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.\nSome users have been recommending other animation programs to use as a replacement, including\nMoho Animation\nand\nToon Boom Harmony.\nUpdated, February 4, 2026, to note that Adobe reversed its decision and announced the software would be placed in maintenance mode instead of discontinued.\nTopics\nAdobe ,\nadobe animate ,\nAI ,\nApps ,\nEnterprise\nSarah Perez\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Officials believe that the likely interceptions, which have not previously been reported, risk not only compromising sensitive information transmitted by the satellites but could also allow Moscow to manipulate their trajectories or even crash them. Russian space vehicles have shadowed European satellites more intensively over the past three years, at a time of high tension between the Kremlin and the west following Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For several years, military and civilian space authorities in the west have been tracking the activities of Luch-1 and Luch-2 \u2014 two Russian objects that have carried out repeated suspicious manoeuvres in orbit. Both vehicles have made risky close approaches to some of Europe\u2019s most important geostationary satellites, which operate high above the Earth and service the continent, including the UK, as well as large parts of Africa and the Middle East. According to orbital data and ground-based telescopic observations, they have lingered nearby for weeks at a time, particularly over the past three years. Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has approached 17 European satellites. Both satellites are suspected of \u201cdoing sigint [signals intelligence] business\u201d, Major General Michael Traut, head of the German military\u2019s space command, told the Financial Times, referring to the satellites\u2019 practice of staying close to western communications satellites. A senior European intelligence official said the Luch vehicles were almost certainly intended to position themselves within the narrow cone of data beams transmitted from Earth-based stations to the satellites. The official expressed concern that sensitive information \u2014 notably command data for European satellites \u2014 is unencrypted, because many were launched years ago without advanced onboard computers or encryption capabilities. This leaves them vulnerable to future interference \u2014 or even destruction \u2014 once hostile actors have recorded their command data. The manoeuvres in space come as Russia steps up its \u201chybrid warfare\u201d in Europe, including sabotage operations such as the severing of subsea internet and power cables. Intelligence and military officials are increasingly worried that the Kremlin could extend such disruptive activity into space, and is already developing the capability to do so. While China and the US have developed similar technologies, Russia has one of the most advanced space-spying programmes and has been more aggressive in its use of the vehicles to stalk satellites. \u201cSatellite networks are an Achilles heel of modern societies. Whoever attacks them can paralyse entire nations,\u201d German defence minister Boris Pistorius said in a speech last September. \u201cThe Russian activities are a fundamental threat to all of us, especially in space. A threat we must no longer ignore,\u201d he added. The European satellites approached by Luch 1 and 2 are primarily used for civilian purposes, such as satellite television, but also carry sensitive government and some military communications. Luch 1 and Luch 2 are unlikely to have the capability to jam or destroy satellites themselves, the European intelligence official said. However, they have probably provided Russia with large amounts of data on how such systems could be disrupted, both from the ground and in orbit. Maj Gen Traut said he presumed the Luch satellites had intercepted the \u201ccommand link\u201d of the satellites they approached \u2014 the channel linking satellites to ground controllers that allows orbital adjustments. Analysts say that with such information, Russia could mimic ground operators, beaming false commands to satellites to manipulate their thrusters used for minor orbital adjustments.\u00a0 Those thrusters could also be used to knock satellites out of alignment or even cause them to crash back to Earth or drift into space. Intelligence gathered by Luch 1 and 2 could also help Russia co-ordinate less overt attacks on western interests. Monitoring other satellites can reveal who is using them and where \u2014 information that could later be exploited for targeted ground-based jamming or hacking operations. The Luch vehicles were \u201cmanoeuvring about and parking themselves close to geostationary satellites, often for many months at a time\u201d, said Belinda Marchand, chief science officer at Slingshot Aerospace, a US-based company that tracks objects in space using ground-based sensors and artificial intelligence. She added that Luch 2 was currently \u201cin proximity\u201d to Intelsat 39, a large geostationary satellite that services Europe and Africa. Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has hovered near at least 17 other geostationary satellites above Europe serving both commercial and government purposes, Slingshot data shows. \u201cThey have visited the same families, the same operators \u2014 so you can deduce that they have a specific purpose or interest,\u201d said Norbert Pouzin, senior orbital analyst at Aldoria, a French satellite tracking company that has also shadowed the Luch satellites. \u201cThese are all Nato-based operators.\u201d \u201cEven if they cannot decrypt messages, they can still extract a lot of information\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they can map how a satellite is being used, work out the location of ground terminals, for example,\u201d he added. Pouzin also said that Russia now seemed to be ramping up its reconnaissance activity in space, launching two new satellites last year named Cosmos 2589 and Cosmos 2590. The vehicles appear to have similarly manoeuvrable capabilities to Luch-1 and Luch-2. Cosmos 2589 is now on its way to the same range as geostationary satellites, which orbit 35,000km above Earth, Pouzin said. But Luch-1 may no longer be functional. On January 30, Earth telescopes observed what appeared to be a plume of gas coming from the satellite. Shortly after, it appeared to at least partially fragment. \u201cIt looks like it began with something to do with the propulsion,\u201d said Marchand, adding that afterwards there \u201cwas certainly a fragmentation\u201d and the satellite was \u201cstill tumbling\u201d. \u00a9 The Financial Times Limited 2026.

February 04, 2026 Clash Report A - A + According to Western space authorities, the Russian satellites \u2014 known as Luch-1 and Luch-2 \u2014 have been conducting repeated close-proximity manoeuvres near European geostationary satellites, remaining nearby for weeks or even months at a time, according to a report by the\nFinancial Times . Orbital data and ground-based telescope observations show that since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 alone has approached at least 17 European satellites, many of which are operated by NATO-based entities. \u201cThese satellites are suspected of conducting signals intelligence operations,\u201d Major General Michael Traut, head of Germany\u2019s military space command, said, noting that the Russian vehicles were positioning themselves unusually close to Western communications satellites. Unencrypted Command Links Raise Security Risks A senior European intelligence official warned that many European satellites remain vulnerable because their command data is not encrypted, as they were launched years ago without advanced onboard computing or encryption systems. Officials believe the Russian spacecraft were positioning themselves within the narrow data transmission cones linking satellites to Earth-based ground stations, potentially allowing Moscow to record command signals used to control satellite orbits. This could enable hostile actors to later mimic ground controllers, issue false commands, manipulate satellite trajectories, or in extreme cases, cause satellites to drift off course or re-enter the atmosphere. Hybrid Warfare Extending Into Space The suspected space interceptions come amid growing concern that Russia is expanding its hybrid warfare tactics in Europe, following sabotage incidents such as damage to subsea internet and power cables. European intelligence and military officials increasingly fear that similar disruptive activities could be extended into space, exploiting the vulnerability of satellite networks that underpin modern civilian, commercial and military communications. \u201cSatellite networks are an Achilles\u2019 heel of modern societies,\u201d German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said in a speech last September. \u201cWhoever attacks them can paralyse entire nations.\u201d Civilian Satellites With Sensitive Roles While the targeted satellites are primarily used for civilian purposes such as satellite television, officials noted that many also carry government and limited military communications, increasing the strategic significance of the suspected interceptions. Although Luch-1 and Luch-2 are not believed to have the capability to directly destroy or jam satellites, intelligence officials said the data gathered could help Russia develop ground-based jamming or cyber operations against Western space assets. Monitoring satellite usage can also reveal who is using them, when and where \u2014 intelligence that could later be exploited for targeted interference. Growing Russian Reconnaissance Capabilities Space analysts say Russia appears to be accelerating its orbital reconnaissance programme. Two additional satellites, Cosmos 2589 and Cosmos 2590, were launched last year and appear to have manoeuvrable capabilities similar to the Luch vehicles. One of them is reportedly moving toward geostationary orbit, roughly 35,000 kilometres above Earth, where many of Europe\u2019s most critical satellites operate. However, Luch-1 may no longer be fully operational. On January 30, telescopic observations detected what appeared to be a propulsion-related gas plume followed by partial fragmentation, suggesting a possible malfunction. Escalating Threat Perception Analysts tracking Russian satellite activity say the repeated approaches to the same satellite operators point to deliberate intelligence-gathering missions. \u201cThey have visited the same families, the same operators \u2014 all NATO-based,\u201d said one senior orbital analyst, adding that even without decryption capabilities, significant operational intelligence can still be extracted. European officials warned that Russia\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour in space represents a fundamental security challenge that Western governments can no longer afford to overlook.

Boeing has spent years developing the SLS, or Space Launch System, which would be the most powerful rocket ever built, with the goal of resuming manned space missions to the Moon. A capsule for astronauts, Orion, is being built by Lockheed-Martin and Europe for the missions. After a three year delay, a first unmanned mission around the Moon and back, dubbed EM-1, has been scheduled for June 2020. But NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told a Senate hearing that the \"SLS is struggling to meet its schedule\" and won't be ready in time for the EM-1 mission. \"Last week it came to our attention that we're not going to be able to maintain the schedule,\" he told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. It is the first time that NASA has clearly acknowledged the extent of the problems with the SLS, which according to an inspector general's report last August has so far cost the space agency more than $12 billion to develop. Bridenstine then made the shocking announcement that he wants to entrust the EM-1 mission in June 2020 to existing private launch systems, instead of waiting for SLS to be ready. He did not say which private company he had in mind, but SpaceX would be a natural candidate with its Falcon Heavy rocket. United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy also would be a capable alternative. United Launch Alliance is a joint venture of Lockheed and Boeing. SpaceX was founded by billionaire Elon Musk. \"We have amazing capability that exists right now that we can use off the shelf in order to accomplish this objective,\" Bridenstine said. The new plan would consist of first launching the Orion capsule, and then follow it with the launch of an upper stage for propulsion. The two elements will then dock in orbit for the voyage around the Moon. No rocket in existence today is capable of lifting both elements together, because of their weight, which is why NASA needed the more powerful SLS. \"I want to be clear, we do not have right now an ability to dock the Orion crew capsule with anything in orbit. So between now and June of 2020, we would have to make that a reality,\" Bridenstine said. \"NASA has a history of not meeting launch dates, and I'm trying to change that,\" he said.

A capsule for astronauts, Orion, is being built by Lockheed-Martin and Europe for the missions.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAfter a three year delay, a first unmanned mission around the Moon and back, dubbed EM-1, has been scheduled for June 2020.\nBut NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told a Senate hearing that the \"SLS is struggling to meet its schedule\" and won't be ready in time for the EM-1 mission.\n\"Last week it came to our attention that we're not going to be able to maintain the schedule,\" he told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\nIt is the first time that NASA has clearly acknowledged the extent of the problems with the SLS, which according to an inspector general's report last August has so far cost the space agency more than $12 billion to develop.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBridenstine then made the shocking announcement that he wants to entrust the EM-1 mission in June 2020 to existing private launch systems, instead of waiting for SLS to be ready.\nHe did not say which private company he had in mind, but SpaceX would be a natural candidate with its Falcon Heavy rocket. United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy also would be a capable alternative.\nUnited Launch Alliance is a joint venture of Lockheed and Boeing. SpaceX was founded by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\"We have amazing capability that exists right now that we can use off the shelf in order to accomplish this objective,\" Bridenstine said.\nThe new plan would consist of first launching the Orion capsule, and then follow it with the launch of an upper stage for propulsion. The two elements will then dock in orbit for the voyage around the Moon.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nNo rocket in existence today is capable of lifting both elements together, because of their weight, which is why NASA needed the more powerful SLS.\n\"I want to be clear, we do not have right now an ability to dock the Orion crew capsule with anything in orbit.

Discovery , promising to give them a \u201cbigger audience.\u201d Last week, the streaming giant offered an\namended all-cash bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s\nstreaming and studio assets, replacing the previous stock-and-cash deal the two companies had reached last month.\nAs questions and concerns continue to swirl about what a merger could mean for the future of HBO Max and the talent behind its success, Peters has said he\u2019s confident the content will remain just as strong because \u201cwe\u2019re going to keep that HBO team.\u201d \u201cThat HBO team is good at working with that talent and giving them the environment that they need to tell those amazing stories,\u201d he told\nStratechery . \u201cAnd they get to do it under a great brand that speaks to the kind of program they\u2019re trying to make, and we\u2019re going to give them a bigger audience.\u201d HBO has been the mastermind behind numerous smash hit Emmy-winning originals, such as\nGame of Thrones ,\nSuccession\nand\nThe White Lotus . It recently released the\nsoapy gay sports romance drama\nHeated Rivalry , which has since become one of its top-rated series.\nNetflix has struck an all-cash deal to acquire Warner Bros.\n( Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images ) When asked about whether Netflix plans to keep HBO Max as a separate service or combine the two, Peters stayed coy.\n\u201cThis is the kind of thing we would want to sort out and we\u2019ve got some thinking originally,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cWe want to do some more work on that one. But there\u2019s clearly, I would say, we know from our work in doing this with other providers that there are benefits. We can make a win-win, we can make a better product for consumers, lower price ultimately, and it works better for the business, we know that that\u2019s capable.\u201d Netflix and Warner Bros. have been in talks to merge since November, when the former announced it had proposed an acquisition. The following month, WBD agreed to sell its studio and streaming operations to\nNetflix in a lucrative $82.7 billion deal. The stunning agreement came after Paramount Skydance had initially offered to acquire the entire company, which includes prominent networks such as CNN and Discovery, beyond just the studio and streaming divisions. Within days of WBD\u2019s agreement with Netflix, Paramount Skydance went public with its hostile takeover bid of $77 billion.\nEven as it later enhanced its offer to all-cash $30 per share , WBD continued to urge its shareholders to remain steadfast in accepting Netflix\u2019s competing offer. Paramount Skydance, controlled by David Ellison, has\nsince filed a lawsuit against WBD\nrequesting that it provide information about its sale process and\npending multi-billion-dollar deal with rival Netflix .

At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia\u2019s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was \u201cnever a commitment,\u201d and Reuters\nreports\nthat OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.\nReuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in\nOpenAI\u2019s Codex , an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex\u2019s performance limitations to Nvidia\u2019s GPU-based hardware.\nAfter the Reuters story published and Nvidia\u2019s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\nposted\non X: \u201cWe love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don\u2019t get where all this insanity is coming from.\u201d\nWhat happened to the $100 billion?\nThe September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia\u2019s total GPU shipments for the year. \u201cThis is a giant project,\u201d Huang said.\nBut the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he\ntold reporters\nin Taiwan that the $100 billion was \u201cnever a commitment.\u201d He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest \u201cup to\u201d that amount and that Nvidia would \u201cinvest one step at a time.\u201d\n\u201cWe are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,\u201d Huang said. \u201cSam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we\u2019ve ever made.\u201d But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, \u201cNo, no, nothing like that.\u201d\nA Wall Street Journal\nreport\non Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI\u2019s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims \u201cnonsense.\u201d\nNvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital,\ntold CNBC\nthat the back-and-forth was unusual. \u201cOne of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn\u2019t a strong \u2018It will be $100 billion.\u2019 It was, \u2018It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.\u2019 And so I do think there are some question marks there.\u201d\nIn September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management,\nnoted\nthe circular nature of such investments to CNBC. \u201cNvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,\u201d Talkington said. \u201cI feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.\u201d\nTech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia\u2019s circular investments for some time, which\ntouch\ndozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.\n\u201cNVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,\u201d Zitron\nwrote\non Bluesky last September, \u201ceven though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.\u201d\nChips from other places\nOutside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia\nstruck\na $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI\u2019s talks with Groq. Nvidia\nhired\nGroq\u2019s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with other senior leaders, as part of the arrangement.\nIn January, OpenAI\nannounced\na $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds \u201ca dedicated low-latency inference solution\u201d to OpenAI\u2019s platform.\nBut OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company\nstruck an agreement\nwith AMD in October for 6 gigawatts of GPUs and\nannounced plans\nwith Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

The prosecutor's office also said both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April. In a separate development, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced a probe into Musk's AI tool, Grok, over its \"potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.\" Writing on X, Musk said the raid was a \"political attack\". The company said\nin a statement\nthat it was \"disappointed\" but \"not surprised,\" and accused the Paris Public Prosecutor's office of an \"abusive act.\" X also denied any wrongdoing and said the raid \"endangers free speech.\" The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X's algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk's controversial AI chatbot, Grok. Yaccarino also took to X to accuse French prosecutors of carrying out \"a political vendetta against Americans.\" \"To be clear: they are lying,\" added Yaccarino, who left the firm last year. Following Tuesday's raid, French prosecutors say they are now\ninvestigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas. Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group. New UK investigation Meanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X. The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a\nbarrage of criticism\nin January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians. The company\neventually intervened\nto prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations. In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as \"a matter of urgency\". But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots. However, shortly afterwards the ICO said\nit was launching its own probe , in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok. \"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director for regulatory risk & innovation. In late January, the European Commission\nannounced an investigation\ninto its parent company xAI over concerns about the images. A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X's office in Paris. 'Not a free country' Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being \"the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom\".\n\"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,\" he added\nin a post on X . Durov was\narrested and detained in France\nin August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity. He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest. These included sharing some user data\nwith authorities in response to legal requests .

They have also summoned billionaire owner Elon Musk for questioning.\nX and Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI are also under scrutiny from Britain's data privacy regulator, which kicked off formal investigations into how the companies handled personal data when they developed and deployed Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. Grok sparked global outrage last month after it pumped out a torrent of sexualized nonconsensual deepfake images in response to requests from X users. Deepfakes are manipulations based on advanced AI, where images, audio or video are either digitally altered or fully generated by AI.\nWATCH | French police raid X: Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit searches X's office in France February 3 | Duration\n2:04 French police on Tuesday raided the offices of Elon Musk's social media network X and prosecutors have ordered the tech billionaire to face questions in April related to a widening investigation into the platform, including alleged 'complicity' of possessing and spreading child sexual abuse images and deepfakes. What is Grok?\nGrok was built by xAI and is available on X, where it encourages users to \"ask anything.\" Users frequently ask Grok to verify videos, images and information in X posts, and to explain or elaborate on subjects.\nGrok's website describes the tool as\u00a0\" a free AI assistant designed by xAI to maximize truth and objectivity.\" Critics have said it is programmed to reflect Musk's views. Musk has\nopenly talked about\n\"fixing\" Grok after it gave answers he didn't like.\nSexual deepfakes on X show need for Canadian online regulator, advocates say CBC Investigates This mom\u2019s son was asking Tesla\u2019s Grok AI chatbot about soccer. It told him to send nude pics, she says Grok can also be used to create or edit images using prompts in the search bar available on X, which led to the deepfake controversy. Reuters has found the chatbot continues to generate sexualized \u200bimages of\u00a0people even when users explicitly warn that the subjects do not\u00a0consent. On Monday, SpaceX, Musk's space exploration and rocket business, announced that it had acquired xAI in a deal that will also combine Grok, X and his satellite communication company Starlink. Why are French police investigating? The French investigation was opened in January last year by the prosecutors' cybercrime unit, the Paris prosecutors' office said in a statement. Authorities opened the investigation after reports from a French lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms on X likely distorted the functioning of an automated data processing system. It expanded its investigation after Grok generated posts that\nallegedly denied the Holocaust\n\u2014 a crime in France \u2014 and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said. It's now looking into alleged \"complicity\" in possessing and spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organized group, among other charges. Prosecutors asked Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino to attend \"voluntary interviews\" on April 20. Employees of X were summoned that same week to be heard as witnesses, the statement said. Yaccarino was CEO from May 2023\nuntil July 2025 . Musk's xAI adds new restrictions to Grok after uproar over sexual images Malaysia, Indonesia become 1st countries to block Musk's Grok over sexualized AI images In a message posted on X, the Paris prosecutors' office announced the ongoing searches at the company's offices in France and said it was leaving the platform. \"At this stage, the conduct of the investigation is based on a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French law, as it operates on the national territory,\" the prosecutors' statement said. European Union police agency Europol \"is supporting the French authorities in this,\" Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth told The Associated Press, without elaborating. A billboard organized by corporate accountability group Eko passes through Westminster urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to stand up to Elon Musk and ban X and Grok, in London, U.K., last month.\n(Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters) How have X, Musk responded? The company defended itself in a statement on the social media platform. \"The Paris Public Prosecutor's Office is plainly\u00a0attempting to exert pressure on X's senior management in the\u00a0United States by targeting our French entity and employees, who\u00a0 are not the focus of this investigation,\" X said in a statement. Elon Musk's Grok AI says images of 'minors in minimal clothing' caused by safeguard lapses \"The Prosecutor's Office has \u2060ignored the established\u00a0procedural mechanisms to obtain evidence in compliance with\u00a0international treaties and X\u2019s rights to defend itself.\" Musk\nshared the statement , adding, \"This is a political attack.\"\nWATCH | Preventing sharing of deepfakes on X will require legislation, law prof. says: Should Canada crack down on Elon Musk's Grok AI? January 13 | Duration\n4:23 Law professor Kristen Thomasen says preventing the sharing of non-consensual deepfakes on X will likely require government legislation, warning it's a structural issue that users have limited means to solve. What other investigations is X facing? Canada's\nprivacy commissioner Philippe Dufresne said last month\nhe is expanding an investigation into X following reports that Grok was being used to create and share explicit images of people without their consent.\u00a0 Malaysia and Indonesia both temporarily banned Grok last month, but both bans have\nsince been lifted . Artificial Intelligence Minister Evan Solomon said last month that Canada is not considering a ban on X \u2014 a comment that drew praise from Musk.\nIn Britain, the Information Commissioner's Office said it's looking into whether X and xAI followed the law when processing personal data and whether Grok had any measures in place to prevent its use to generate \"harmful manipulated images.\" Canada Pension Plan's investment arm criticized over funding for Elon Musk's xAI, maker of Grok Musk chatbot Grok removes posts after complaints of antisemitism, praise for Hitler \"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcolm, an executive director at the watchdog.

Nintendo won't beat PlayStation 2 ever, because they didn't beat it during that era. The PS2 was discounted, just as all consoles received discounts across the generation, back then. Nintendo discounted their console bundles. They discounted Gamecube, their direct competitor to PlayStation 2, and it still topped out at 22 million officially recorded sales. Maybe they actually made 28 million. They still lost. They were crushed by PlayStation 2, in that era.

Zero November 2024 Sales Charts: Nintendo Switch Passes PS2 to Become the Second Best-Selling Gaming Hardware in U.S. History Look out, Nintendo DS. By\u00a0 Rebekah Valentine Updated :\nJan 23, 2025 12:45pm UTC 343 comments The Nintendo Switch has officially passed the PlayStation 2 to become the second best-selling gaming hardware in the United States, now trailing only the Nintendo DS. This comes from Circana's November video game sales report, which states that lifetime unit sales of the Nintendo Switch are now at 46.6 million.\nUpdate 12:20pm PT:\nPiscatella tells IGN that the Switch currently trails the Nintendo DS by over 7 million units in the U.S., so it's probably not catching up anytime soon. Original story continues below: But Switch sales are still slowing down. Per analysis from Circana's Mat Piscatella, it was only the second best-selling console for November, following the PS5 in both unit and dollar sales, with Xbox Series consoles in third. Overall hardware spending was flat, with 15% year-over-year growth for PlayStation hardware off-setting a 29% drop in Xbox Series sales and 3% drop on Switch. PS5 sales were driven in part by the release of the PS5 Pro, which accounted for 19% of all PS5 unit sales last month and 28% of all dollar sales. Notably, launch month dollar sales of the PS5 Pro were over 50% higher than launch month sales of the PS4 Pro, but unit sales were 12% lower. This isn't surprising, and\nis roughly in line with analyst expectations , given that the PS4 Pro launched at $399 and the PS5 Pro launched at $699. Update 12:20pm PT:\nI asked Piscatella what he made of the PS5's relatively smaller unit sales compared to larger dollar sales, and if they were in line with his expectations. He responded as follows: The PS5 Pro was always targeted at the hyper enthusiast niche, which is an audience that generally doesn't mind paying a high price for even nominal improvements. Given the far higher price of PS5 Pro it saw a solid unit launch sales result. The question is how the legs will be, and if the PS5 Pro is going to keep pace with the sales curve of PS4 Pro or if it will fall off now that were past the day 1 buyer. I'm anticipating it will fall off the pace a bit more, but at that price it can and still show a dollar sales increase. Original story continues below:\nSpending on games overall was down 7% year-over-year to $5.8 billion, and overall software spending was down 9% year-over-year to $4.5 billion. Both of these drops were in large part simply due to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch timing compared to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year. Black Ops 6 launched in October this year, elevating sales that month, while Modern Warfare 3's November launch last year pumped that month's numbers and made for a tougher comparable this year as Black Ops 6 sales settle down a bit. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was still the best-selling game this month, however, and is the second best-selling game of the year thus far. It trails only EA Sports College Football 25, which is now the best-selling sports game in U.S. history by dollar sales, and ranks among the 50 best-selling games of all time by the same metric. Mario & Luigi: Brothership debuted at No.7 for the month, right behind Super Mario Party Jamboree at No.6. Both games' position on the chart only reflects physical sales, however, so it's possible the inclusion of digital sales could have pushed either higher. A few other big new games this month aren't reflected on the best-seller charts for various reasons. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl launched on Game Pass, which means a lot of people played it for \"free.\" But it debuted at No.6 on Circana's Player Engagement Tracker Xbox Monthly Active Users chart, and it ranked No.9 for Steam MAUs, indicating it's doing all right for itself. In a similar situation, free-to-play Genshin Impact launched on Xbox in November, and debuted at No.10 for Xbox MAUs. And over on mobile, Pokemon TCG Pocket was the second best-selling mobile game by revenue worldwide in November, beating out the incredibly popular Monopoly GO. It was the sixth best-selling mobile game in the States for the month.

From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google\u2019s shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034.\nThe documents were filed as part of Google\u2019s long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a\nverdict in 2024 . While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to\nThe Verge , the company\u2019s plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial.\nAs Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser ( which it did ). In Judge Amit Mehta\u2019s final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans.\nThe filing suggests Google is done with ChromeOS after the current support window.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nThe filing suggests Google is done with ChromeOS after the current support window.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nGoogle\u2019s Android chief, Sameer Samat, previously testified that Google was aiming to launch its first Aluminium machines in 2026. However, the new filings expand on that, saying that Google hopes to get Aluminium in the hands of trusted testers by late 2026. A full retail release may not happen until 2028. Google expects Aluminium to supplant ChromeOS in enterprise and education, which puts Chromebooks on the chopping block. Outside of a\npandemic-era bump\nas workers sought cheap at-home machines, Chromebooks have never expanded much beyond those markets.\nThe documents suggest that Google will wash its hands of ChromeOS once the current support window closes. Google promises 10 years of Chromebook support, but that\u2019s not counted from the date of purchase\u2014Chromebooks are based on a handful of hardware platforms dictated by Google, with the most recent launching in 2023. That means Google has to support the newest devices through 2033. The \u201ctimeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034,\u201d says the filing.\nAndroid goes big\nFrom the start, the ChromeOS experience was focused on the web. Google initially didn\u2019t even support running local apps, but little by little, its aspirations grew. Over the years, it has added Linux apps and Android apps. And it even tried to get Steam games running on Chromebooks\u2014it\ngave up on that last one just recently . It also tried to shoehorn AI features into ChromeOS with the\nChromebook Plus\nplatform, to little effect.\nAndroid was barely getting off the ground when ChromeOS began its journey, but as we approach the 2030s, Google clearly wants a more powerful desktop platform. Android has struggled on larger screens, but Aluminium is a long-running project to fix that. Whatever we see in 2028 may not even look like the Android we know from phones. It will have many of the same components under the hood, though.\nAluminium will have Google apps at the core.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nAluminium will have Google apps at the core.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nGoogle could get everything it wants with the upcoming Aluminium release. When running on powerful laptop hardware, Android\u2019s performance and capabilities should far outstrip ChromeOS. Aluminium is also expected to run Google apps like Chrome and the Play Store with special system privileges, leaving third-party apps with fewer features. That gives Google more latitude in how it manages the platform and retains users, all without running afoul of recent antitrust rulings.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

The revelation, buried within legal documents submitted as part of ongoing antitrust litigation, marks a significant strategic shift for a company that has invested more than a decade building ChromeOS into a dominant force in educational technology markets.\nThe implications extend far beyond corporate strategy sessions in Mountain View. School districts across America have purchased millions of Chromebooks, betting their digital infrastructure on Google\u2019s promise of simple, secure, and affordable computing. Enterprise customers have similarly embraced the platform for its manageability and low total cost of ownership. Now, these stakeholders face uncertainty about the longevity of their investments and the future support commitments from Google.\nThe Genesis and Evolution of a Cloud-First Vision\nWhen Google first unveiled ChromeOS in 2009, the concept seemed almost radical: an operating system built entirely around a web browser, with applications living in the cloud rather than on local storage. The pitch was elegantly simple\u2014instant boot times, automatic updates, inherent security through sandboxing, and minimal hardware requirements that could breathe new life into modestly-specced machines.\nThe education sector proved to be ChromeOS\u2019s promised land. By 2016, Chromebooks had captured more than half of the U.S. K-12 market, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. The platform\u2019s appeal was multifaceted: devices cost a fraction of traditional laptops, management consoles allowed IT administrators to control thousands of devices from a single dashboard, and the simplified interface reduced support burdens for resource-constrained school districts. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this adoption, as schools scrambling to enable remote learning turned to Chromebooks as an affordable solution for getting devices into students\u2019 hands.\nYet even as ChromeOS achieved market dominance in education, Google faced persistent challenges in expanding beyond this niche. Consumer adoption remained tepid, with most users still preferring Windows or macOS for personal computing. Enterprise uptake, while growing, never reached the critical mass that would establish ChromeOS as a true competitor to Microsoft\u2019s entrenched position in business computing. The platform existed in a curious state\u2014wildly successful in one vertical market while struggling to gain traction elsewhere.\nAndroid Ascendant: The Technical and Strategic Rationale\nThe court filings reveal what industry observers have long suspected: Google sees greater strategic value in consolidating its efforts around Android rather than maintaining two separate operating systems. From a technical perspective, this consolidation makes considerable sense. Android boasts a vastly larger application ecosystem, with millions of apps available through the Google Play Store compared to ChromeOS\u2019s more limited selection of web apps and the subset of Android apps that run on Chromebooks.\nAndroid\u2019s flexibility across form factors\u2014from smartphones to tablets to televisions\u2014offers Google a unified platform that can scale across its entire hardware ecosystem. The company has already demonstrated this vision with products like the Pixel Tablet, which blurs the lines between mobile and desktop computing. By investing development resources into a single platform, Google can accelerate innovation and reduce the overhead of maintaining parallel codebases.\nMoreover, the rise of progressive web applications has undermined one of ChromeOS\u2019s original value propositions. When ChromeOS launched, the distinction between web apps and native applications was stark. Today, PWAs can offer near-native performance and functionality while maintaining the cross-platform compatibility that web technologies provide. This evolution has made the ChromeOS approach less unique and potentially less necessary.\nThe Education Market Dilemma and Transition Challenges\nFor Google, managing the transition away from ChromeOS presents a delicate balancing act, particularly in the education sector where the company has cultivated deep relationships and dependencies. School districts have invested not just in hardware but in training teachers, developing curricula around Google Workspace for Education, and building institutional knowledge around ChromeOS management and deployment.\nThe court filings do not specify a timeline for ChromeOS\u2019s end-of-life, and Google has not made any public announcements about deprecating the platform. However, the mere acknowledgment in legal documents that ChromeOS has a finite lifespan raises urgent questions about support commitments, migration paths, and the longevity of existing Chromebook deployments. Educational institutions typically plan technology purchases on multi-year cycles, and uncertainty about platform stability could significantly impact future procurement decisions.\nIndustry analysts suggest that Google will likely pursue a gradual transition strategy, perhaps similar to how the company has handled other product sunsets. This could involve extended support periods for existing ChromeOS devices while new products ship with Android-based alternatives. The company might also develop tools to ease migration, ensuring that schools can transition their management infrastructure and user data with minimal disruption.\nCompetitive Implications and Market Repositioning\nThe potential demise of ChromeOS creates both opportunities and challenges for Google\u2019s competitors. Microsoft, which has watched Google dominate education markets with a mixture of envy and frustration, may see an opening to reclaim lost ground. The company has already been positioning Windows 11 SE and affordable Windows devices as alternatives to Chromebooks, emphasizing compatibility with existing educational software and the familiarity of the Windows environment.\nApple, meanwhile, continues to push its iPad as the future of educational computing, though the company\u2019s premium pricing has limited its penetration in budget-conscious school districts. A transition period where schools reevaluate their technology strategies could provide Apple with opportunities to make inroads, particularly in districts willing to invest more per device for perceived quality and ecosystem integration.\nFor Google, the shift to Android in computing devices represents both a consolidation and an expansion of ambition. Rather than maintaining ChromeOS as a specialized tool for specific use cases, the company appears to be betting that Android can evolve into a truly universal platform\u2014one that serves equally well whether running on a smartphone in your pocket, a tablet on your coffee table, or a laptop on your desk.\nThe Broader Pattern of Google Product Evolution\nChromeOS\u2019s apparent expiration date fits into a broader pattern of Google product evolution and, occasionally, abandonment. The company has developed a reputation\u2014fair or not\u2014for launching ambitious projects only to sunset them when they fail to achieve sufficient scale or strategic importance. Google Reader, Google+, and numerous other products have met this fate, sometimes to the vocal dismay of dedicated user communities.\nHowever, ChromeOS differs from many of Google\u2019s discontinued products in important ways. It achieved genuine market success and established itself as a critical piece of infrastructure for millions of users. The platform generated real revenue through device sales and education subscriptions. Its potential end represents not the failure of a product to find market fit, but rather a strategic decision to consolidate resources around a different platform that Google believes offers greater long-term potential.\nThis distinction matters because it affects how stakeholders should interpret and respond to the news. ChromeOS users aren\u2019t being abandoned because the product failed; they\u2019re being migrated because Google has chosen a different path forward. The company\u2019s challenge will be executing this migration in a way that preserves the trust and goodwill it has built, particularly in the education sector where institutional relationships and long-term commitments carry significant weight.\nLooking Ahead: The Android-First Future\nAs Google navigates this transition, several questions remain unanswered.

But, in court documents\nsurfaced by\nThe Verge , it sounds like 2026 was just the goal, and the \u201cfull\u201d arrival might take a bit longer.\nThe documents reveal that while Google will have a release of Android\u2019s desktop UI \u2013 known as \u201cAluminium OS\u201d \u2013 for \u201ccommercial trusted testers\u201d in 2026, a \u201cfull release\u201d isn\u2019t expected until 2028. \u201cEnterprise and education sectors\u201d would be included in the 2028 release, suggesting that the 2026 release might focus on consumers (speculation on our part, to be clear), or just not be widely sold at all to start. Given the heavy focus for ChromeOS today on enterprise and education, it makes sense to give \u201cAluminium\u201d a bit more time in the oven before replacing everything.\nBeyond that, ChromeOS as we know it today\nis\ndying, Google\u2019s lawyers revealed.\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\nThe court documents reveal that the \u201ctimeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034.\u201d In other words, Google is pulling the plug as soon as it can.\nAs previously hinted at by a Google VP , lawyers spelled out that the lack of compatibility between most existing Chromebook hardware and \u201cAluminium OS\u201d requires Google \u201cto maintain existing ChromeOS at least through 2033 to meet its \u201810 year support commitment\u2019 to existing users.\u201d\nOne illustration, seen below, also describes \u201cAluminium\u201d as follows:\nAluminium (\u2018ChromeOS\u2019 built on the Android stack) will leverage Android\u2019s pre-existing stack.\nThat was all revealed in court documents surrounding the antitrust case that, at one point, threatened to force Google into selling Chrome. As it turns out, a key reason why Google was allowed to retain Chrome was ChromeOS, and specifically, how long it would need to stick around. Google being forced to sell off Chrome with all of these plans in process would mean that it would be much more difficult to support ChromeOS on older machines.\nInterestingly, this case also revealed that devices \u201con which the ChromeOS operating system or a successor to the ChromeOS operating system is installed\u201d are excluded from a ban that prevents Google from making deals around prioritizing/requiring Google apps on Android devices.\nGoogle apparently declined to comment on these timelines, so it\u2019s hard to know if the 2028 timeline is still in place or not. In any case, it\u2019s arguably more interesting to hear that Google has pretty clear plans to kill ChromeOS as soon as support for existing devices is wrapped up.\nMore on Android:\nAndroid\u2019s full desktop interface leaks: New status bar, Chrome Extensions, more [Video]\nAyaneo launches Android \u2018Pocket S Mini\u2019 handheld at $319, skips crowdfunding\nGoogle releases \u2018Desktop Camera\u2019 app that\u2019s seemingly for Android PCs\nFollow Ben: \u00a0 Twitter/X ,\u00a0 Threads ,\nBluesky , and\u00a0 Instagram\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.\nMore.
