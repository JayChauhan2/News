For the first time since last year\u2019s war with Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted indirect talks over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. And for the first time, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test, just one day after letting a key nuclear arms treaty with Russia expire. Nick Schifrin reports.\nRead the Full Transcript\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nGeoff Bennett:\nWelcome to the \"News Hour.\" Today, across two continents, the U.S. confronted two very different nuclear challenges. For the first time since last year's war in Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted diplomacy focused on that country's nuclear program.\nAmna Nawaz:\nAnd for the first time today, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test just one day after letting the final nuclear arms control treaty with Russia expire, Nick Schifrin been covering both stories and joins us now. So, Nick, let's start with the U.S. and Iran. What do we know about how those talks went today?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, the Trump administration has provided no readout at the moment, but in the lead-up to these talks, we heard from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the top negotiator, Steve Witkoff, that Iran must not make any nuclear fuel domestically, must restrict the range of its ballistic missiles, must end its support for proxy groups and account for highly enriched uranium that has been missing since last summer's strikes. Today, the U.S. held indirect talks. You see Witkoff there with the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, meeting Oman's foreign minister, who then met with Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who said the talks focused on nuclear weapons and were a -- quote -- \"good start.\"\nAbbas Araghchi, Iranian Foreign Minister:\nWe were able to exchange our viewpoints, to express our concerns and our interests for a possible deal between the two sides on our nuclear question.\nNick Schifrin:\nAraghchi said there would be a new round of talks. No confirmation of that from the U.S. side, which for the first time included the top U.S. military commander from the Middle East, a reminder, Amna, of President Trump's threats against Iran and that military buildup still in the region.\nAmna Nawaz:\nSo what do the experts tell you all of that means for the possibility of an actual deal?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, that's the question I put to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is very skeptical of any deal of Iran's nuclear program, missile program, or support for proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas. Karim Sadjadpour, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: The Iranian regime still seems so intent on defying the United States and they fear that if they give into pressure, it's going to project weakness and invite even more pressure. Up until now Iran has shown no flexibility on moderating its ballistic missile program, or its regional proxies. And so the Iranian goal is to limit this conversation only to nuclear and even then to drag on the conversation.\nNick Schifrin:\nDrag on the conversation, Amna, so it doesn't get bombed by the United States. A U.S. official, though, confirms to me that Iran is trying to reconstitute its ballistic missile program. Look at the before right there and now look at the after of a missile production facility. Listen to distinguished scholar at Middlebury College Jeffrey Lewis. He's studied these kinds of images for years.\nJeffrey Lewis, Middlebury College:\nWe can see those facilities in satellite images. And so Israel attempted to destroy many of those buildings, but now they're back. It seems pretty clearly that Iran is well on its way to resuming production of its missiles.\nNick Schifrin:\nAnd U.S. officials, Amna, acknowledge that could mean Israel, if not the U.S., try and strike those missile production factories again in 2026.\nAmna Nawaz:\nLet's turn now to those allegations, accusations of a secret nuclear test by China. What exactly is the U.S. saying happened?\nNick Schifrin:\nYes, so, for the first time today, the U.S. revealed that China conducted explosive nuclear tests, including in June 2020, and sought to conceal them by putting the explosion inside an underground chamber. That would be China's first explosive test in some 25 years. Now, former senior officials told me today that they have known about that test for years. So what's interesting perhaps mostly today is the timing. The fact that China conducted that test has not been declassified until today, which happens to be the day after the U.S. let New START, the final nuclear arms control treaty, expire. The Trump administration and some experts have long argued that New START wasn't adequate because it didn't address China's growing arsenal. And so today it seems to be an attempt to try and pressure China into some kind of three-way talks with the United States and Russia about arms control overall. But, honestly, Beijing has always resisted any kind of limits on its nuclear program while it's growing its arsenal, says Jeffrey Lewis.\nJeffrey Lewis:\nChina has largely resisted entering any kind of formal talks, partly because their number is lower than the U.S. and they're in the process of catching up. But I think at a deeper and more profound level, it's because all of the things we want, predictability, transparency, these are things that China thinks are bad for it, because China is worried that, if we find them to be predictable and transparent, that we will be more comfortable pushing them around in a regional security crisis because we will know where their red lines are.\nNick Schifrin:\nWhich means no trilateral talks with China any time soon. And, tonight, I spoke to former Biden senior officials and also Republican senior arms control officials, and both argued to me that the U.S. should deploy more nuclear warheads. And now that New START has expired, they can do exactly that.\nAmna Nawaz:\nNick Schifrin starting our coverage tonight.

He\u2019s toppled a Venezuelan dictator, sent federal agents on a deportation surge into Minnesota that killed two citizens \u2014 and is back\nmaligning the electoral system .\nAnd he is acquiring a taste for putting down a military hammer \u2014 he\u2019s struck sites in Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Venezuela and alleged drug boats in the Pacific and the Caribbean during his first year back in office.\nThat\u2019s one reason why his\nthreats to punish Iran\nfor cracking down on protesters and to prevent it ever reconstituting its nuclear program have teeth, as negotiations open Friday in Oman between officials from Washington and Tehran.\nBut with\napproval ratings\ndipping below 40%, in a midterm election year that already looks grim for Republicans, Trump must consider his ragged domestic standing alongside the hideously difficult military questions he\u2019s facing on Iran.\nTrump believes his volatility widens his negotiating room. Yet amid a new Iran crisis, it\u2019s getting harder to see how he emerges with the kind of crisp, easy win that he craves.\nThe president is convinced that Iran\u2019s clerical leaders want to do a \u201cdeal\u201d to avoid the possibility of war with the United States. He\u2019s amassed a significant naval force in the region and has military options to inflict a grievous blow.\nThis buildup has added steel to hard-driving diplomacy.\nAnd the Iranians may not be able to rely on a TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) moment. Trump\u2019s global belligerence has enforced red lines. He took bold action to assassinate Iranian military and intelligence chief Qasem Soleimani in Iraq in his first term. In his second, he sent US stealth bombers on a daring round-the-world trip to pulverize Iran\u2019s nuclear sites.\nTrump has also plunged into Iranian domestic politics more than any other 21st-century president, warning the clerical regime of reprisals for continued attacks on their own citizens, following a brutal crackdown last month that apparently killed thousands of people in cold blood.\nIn short, Trump has committed immense personal and geopolitical prestige to his latest test of wills with leaders in Tehran.\nWhy Iran is especially vulnerable\nIn this photo obtained by The Associated Press, Iranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran, Iran, on January 9, 2026.\nUGC/AP\nIt might just make sense for Trump to charge through a rare opening: Iran has never been weaker in its 45-year showdown with the United States:\n\u2022 The revolutionary regime\u2019s future is clouded by a succession crisis that is eroding its aura of permanence. The aged Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cannot go on forever.\n\u2022 Its crisis of political legitimacy has never been more extreme. Stark desperation and hopelessness drove protesters to the streets amid food and water shortages and grinding economic conditions.\n\u2022 And Iran\u2019s regional proxies \u2014 including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which once offered an insurance policy against outside attack \u2014 have been devastated by wars with Israel.\nThis trio of factors create a logical rationale for US military action against Iran. There may be no better time for Washington to topple a regime that has haunted its Middle East policy, threatened its allies, and killed many Americans, both in terror attacks and through militias during the Iraq war.\nThe opening may not last long. And if Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu don\u2019t take the shot now, they may regret a lost opportunity in years to come.\nIf Trump managed a feat beyond Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama and Biden by defeating one of America\u2019s most sworn enemies, he\u2019d earn a place in history that couldn\u2019t be denied. Given the current president\u2019s obsession with legacy, this must be a tantalizing prospect.\nIn an administration where the constraints on presidential action have all been removed, it may come down to Trump\u2019s instincts.\n\u201cThe most important deliberations are those which are happening inside President Trump\u2019s head,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson on Monday.\n\u201cI think if you look at his own precedent on three major occasions, he rolled the dice with Iran in 2018 \u2014 he left the nuclear deal. In 2020 he assassinated Iran\u2019s top military commander, Qasem Soleimani. And of course, last June, he bombed their nuclear sites, and he believes that all these decisions were vindicated, and now Iran is weaker than it has been in the past because it doesn\u2019t have any air defenses.\u201d\nSadjadpour went on: \u201cI think that context, coupled with the fact that Iran\u2019s leadership continues to taunt him and added to the fact that there isn\u2019t a grand bargain to be done, there is not a Nixon to China moment where you can get a great deal and normalize relations. And if he\u2019s already said he obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear program last June, it\u2019s unclear to me how getting another nuclear deal is going to be the outcome that he\u2019s looking for here.\u201d\nRisks of military action are higher than in Venezuela\nBut moving forward with military strikes would come with huge risks both in their execution and in the uncertain political conditions they may ensure.\nA serious attempt to either decapitate the Iranian regime or to devastate the military capacity of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Basij paramilitary militia would likely require a multi-day air campaign.\nAttempting to degrade Iran\u2019s capacity to crush new protests would run the high risk of civilian losses given that much of machinery of repression is sited in civilian areas. Without the unthinkable prospect of a major ground invasion, how effective could such an effort be when the recent crackdown was carried out with brutal close-quarters street violence?\nIran, the seat of the ancient Persian civilization, is more contiguous and less plagued by sectarian divides than Iraq \u2014 which splintered after the US invasion in 2003. But no one wants to test the impact of a power vacuum if the government falls, in the absence of any clear path to a return to democracy.\nAnd the short, sharp thunderclap strike of the type Trump prefers and that doesn\u2019t conflict with the no-foreign-quagmires mantra of his MAGA movement may not be sufficient to topple the clerical regime in Tehran.\nBut a longer military engagement with uncertain consequences would severely test Americans\u2019 trust in their president. A war that went wrong could devastate Republicans in November\u2019s already unpromising midterm elections.\nA sense of hubris has gathered around the White House since the toppling of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last month. But major US combat deaths in an Iranian war could effectively drain all the power and legitimacy from Trump\u2019s second term.\nThere\u2019ve also been signs in recent weeks that America\u2019s Gulf allies \u2014 with whom Trump is close \u2014 fear the consequences of a US attack on Iran. Short-term missile strikes by Iran are possible. Tehran could try to cripple regional oil infrastructure. And long-term unrest could jolt a region now transitioning towards lucrative new horizons like AI and tourism.\nSome of Iran\u2019s neighbors also fear chaos could ensue if Khamenei is killed because his country has known nothing but iron rule for more than 40 years. Another possibility is that the clerics could be succeeded by an equally brutal but more secular regime \u2014 that would seek to reconstitute its regional threat.\nIranian people wave national flags and hold up a portrait of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while fireworks illuminate the sky during a pro-government religious rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on February 4, 2026.\nMorteza Nikoubazl/NurPhotoGetty Images\nWhy diplomacy may not work either\nThis is all an argument for stepping back from the brink.\nBut after Trump\u2019s weeks of threatening rhetoric, a decision not to strike Iran could drain international credibility the president amassed with the strikes on the nuclear sites last year and with the stunning raid into Venezuela.\nAnd doesn\u2019t he also owe an obligation to Iran\u2019s people as they dream of freedom?\nTrump\u2019s predecessors avoiding encouraging a counter-revolution in Iran because they feared providing a pretext for even more fierce repression against demonstrators seen as US proxies. Trump had no such qualms and his vow that the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to punish Tehran for its crackdowns conceivably brought more people onto the streets.\nIf the president doesn\u2019t follow up, Iran\u2019s leaders may be even less reticent to inflict horrendous violence on their citizens come the next uprising.\nGiven the complexity of the military equation, it\u2019s obvious why the administration has not closed off a diplomatic exit ramp. But it\u2019s hard to see any deal that the president will offer Iran that it will be prepared to accept \u2014 and vice versa.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio laid out US goals ahead of the talks in Oman.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we\u2019re going to find out,\u201d Rubio said. He made clear that the administration wants to focus on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but ", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/politics/iran-us-negotiations-trump-analysis", "title": "Trump is beset by hard dilemmas and no easy wins with Iran"}}, {"text": "MSN", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/epstein-helped-fund-lavish-lifestyle-for-former-obama-wh-counsel/ar-AA1VmeUQ", "title": "Epstein helped fund lavish lifestyle for former Obama ... - MSN"}}, {"text": "As 'Sell America' market volatility rages on, look to your bonds Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Key Points U.S. investors aren't abandoning U.S assets, but more money has been flowing to international markets, and not just stocks but emerging markets credit, among other fixed-income strategies.\nConcentration in U.S. equities, rising volatility, a weak dollar, and recent hot performance for asset classes like emerging markets bonds, are all pushing portfolios to become broader in holdings across both stocks and bonds.

The U.S. dollar and Treasurys sold off on Tuesday, too.\nPresident Donald Trump's latest round of tariff threats, aimed at pressuring Europe to back a U.S. bid for Greenland, is stoking market instability.\nThe \"Sell America\" trade made a comeback on Tuesday following President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats against European allies, giving investors a taste of the volatility that rocked global markets back in April.\nAfter a short-lived attempt at a recovery in late-morning trading, U.S. stocks moved lower in the afternoon as Trump doubled down during a White House press conference. The selling wasn't confined to stocks: Treasury yields jumped, touching their highest levels since the summer, while the U.S. dollar sold off. Nor was it limited to the U.S., with stocks and bonds around the world selling off on Tuesday while haven assets like gold and the Swiss franc (USDCHF) rallied.\nThe S&P 500 finished Tuesday in the red for 2026, the first time that has happened this year.\n\"'Sell America' is back in a new form,\" Gina Martin Adams, chief market strategist at HB Wealth, said during an interview with MarketWatch. \"We came into this year with the market complacent on the idea that trade-policy risk was a 2025 story. It's clearly something we will need to contend with in 2026.\"\nThe S&P 500 SPX was off by 143.15 points, or 2.1%, at 6,796.86, its biggest percentage-point drop since Oct. 10, Dow Jones Market Data showed.\nThe Nasdaq COMP was off by 561.07 points, or 2.4%, at 22,954.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was off by 870.74 points, or 1.8%, at 48,488.59, FactSet data showed. Big Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of megacap stocks shedding a combined $683 billion in market capitalization - the most in a single day since Oct. 10, when Trump escalated his trade rhetoric against China.\nThe Cboe Volatility Index VIX, better known as the VIX or Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" was up by 26.7% at 20.09, finishing above its long-term average of around 19.5, FactSet data showed.\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the dollar's value against a basket of rivals, was off by 0.8% at 98.57 in recent trading after touching its lowest level of 2026. Tuesday's slump erased much of the buck's advance since Christmas Eve.\n\"The market is going to pay attention to the dollar as the harbinger of risk,\" Martin Adams said. \"If the dollar is falling, it is viewed as the anti-U.S. trade.\"\nOver the weekend, Trump said he would slap 10% tariffs on imports from eight European countries beginning next month. He later threatened tariffs as high as 200% on French wine and other products after French President Emmanuel Macron rebuffed Trump's offer to join his Gaza peace board. Trump will speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. Some European lawmakers have urged the European Union to abandon a trade deal with the U.S. An emergency leaders' summit has been scheduled for Thursday to discuss potential retaliatory measures.\nSpeaking during a press conference at Davos earlier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed the reaction to Trump's latest tariff threats. \"I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on April 2nd,\" he said. He urged trade partners not to walk away from their deals with the U.S.\nYields on long-dated Treasury notes and bonds were moving higher, while the U.S. dollar was selling off. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was up 6.4 basis points at 4.294%, according to FactSet data.\n\"I'm concerned on a lot of different levels that the president has pushed it way too far,\" Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, said Tuesday morning.\nThe 30-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was up 8.1 basis points to 4.920%, the biggest one-day rise since July, Dow Jones Market Data showed. Engelke said he thinks the yield could \"very easily\" go up to 5%.\n'Today is a warning'\nWhile it is unusual for U.S. stocks, Treasurys and the dollar to all sell off at the same time, it does happen. Dow Jones Market Data showed 18 instances in 2025 when the S&P 500 and ICE dollar index finished lower while Treasury yields rose. Before Tuesday, the last time this happened was Dec. 1.\nRichard Farr, chief market strategist at Pivotus Partners, cautioned that investors shouldn't read too much into Tuesday's selloff. A feared migration away from U.S. assets didn't pan out in 2025, even after Trump surprised global investors with his \"liberation day\" tariffs in April.\nHowever, he warned that Trump's aggressive rhetoric toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Greenland risked undermining confidence in U.S. bonds and the dollar.\n\"Today is a warning,\" Farr told MarketWatch.\nOthers said there was more at play than just the revived threat of tariffs. Farzin Azarm, managing director of equities trading at Mizuho, said stretched positioning in hot stock-market trades like semiconductor names meant the market was primed for a pullback heading into Tuesday.\n\"I don't buy the tariff concerns. The market needed this,\" he said.\nThe reaction in markets has so far been modest compared with what investors experienced in April. Back then, the S&P 500 skidded right to the edge of bear-market territory before Trump announced a 90-day pause on his tariffs.\nInternationally, the European STOXX 50 XX:SX5P fell for a third day on Tuesday, adding to its losses from Monday's session. The Japanese Nikkei 225 JP:NIK and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HK:11)each fell for a fourth straight day. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF EEM retreated as well, FactSet data showed.\nIn Japan, local government bonds were selling off hard. The yield on the Japanese 40-year bond BX:TMBMKJP-40Y surged to 4.215%, the highest yield ever recorded, according to FactSet. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nThe selloff in Japanese bonds was adding to the pressure facing riskier assets like stocks on Tuesday, Lukman Otunuga, senior markets analyst at FXTM, said in commentary shared with MarketWatch.\nFresh tariff threats could undercut expectations for global economic growth to accelerate in 2026, Otunuga added.\nBitcoin (BTCUSD) retreated below $90,000 on Tuesday shortly after the U.S. equity market opened for business. Prices for the pioneering digital currency were down 3% at $90,323 in recent trading.\nGold and silver hit a fresh round of intraday record highs as investors flocked to the smoking-hot metals trade. Most-active gold futures (GC00) gained $170.40 per troy ounce, or 3.7%, to settle at $4,765.80 an ounce.\nJoy Wiltermuth contributed.\n-Joseph Adinolfi\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump officially unveiled\nTrumpRx.gov , a transformative new government platform that gives Americans direct access to dramatically lower prices on dozens of common, high-cost brand-name prescription drugs.\nSecured through landmark\nMost-Favored-Nation\npricing agreements with leading pharmaceutical manufacturers, these deals ensure Americans pay prices aligned with the lowest in other developed nations, ending decades of overpayment and delivering immediate relief.\nStarting today, American patients \u2014 especially the millions who face high out-of-pocket costs for medications not fully covered by insurance \u2014 can access\nsubstantially lower\nprices on dozens of essential drugs via\nTrumpRx.gov . As the Trump Administration pursues the best possible deals for the American people, additional high-cost medications will be added on a rolling basis.\nKey examples of the savings include:\nGLP-1 medications \u2014 among the highest-spend drugs in the U.S. \u2014 have dramatic price reductions on TrumpRx.gov.\nThe monthly prices of\nOzempic\u00ae\nand injectable\nWegovy\u00ae\ndrop from $1,028 and $1,349, respectively, to an average of $350 and as low as $199, depending on dosage.\nThe monthly price of the\nWegovy\u00ae\npill falls from $1,349 to as low as $149, depending on dosage.\nThe monthly price of\nZepbound\u00ae\nfalls from $1,088 to an average of $346 and as low as $299, depending on dosage.\nMillions of Americans struggling with infertility often pay for fertility treatments entirely out-of-pocket. Thanks to TrumpRx.gov, they stand to save an average of $2,000+ per cycle on common medications.\nThe price of\nGonal-F\u00ae\n\u2014 one of the most commonly-used fertility drugs \u2014 falls to as low as $168 per pen, depending on dosage.\nThe price of\nCetrotide\u00ae\n\u2014 another commonly used fertility drug \u2014 falls from $316 to $22.50.\nThe price of\nOvidrel\u00ae\nfalls from $251 to $84.\nThis launch marks only the beginning.\nThe Trump Administration will be onboarding additional companies that have Most-Favored-Nation agreements and is aggressively pursuing additional agreements to expand the platform \u2014 ultimately driving even greater savings for Americans on prescription drugs.\nFor Americans who obtain their prescriptions through insurance, President Trump calls on Congress to swiftly pass his\nGreat Healthcare Plan .\nThis comprehensive reform would codify the savings from the Most-Favored-Nation initiative, lower insurance premiums, hold big insurance companies accountable, maximize price transparency, and enable coverage of TrumpRx.gov purchases under health plans \u2014 ensuring every American benefits from these historic reductions in drug costs.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/president-trump-launches-trumprx-gov-delivering-massive-immediate-savings-to-millions-of-americans/", "title": "President Trump Launches TrumpRx.gov, Delivering Massive ..."}}, {"text": "TrumpRx: See the 43 drugs available on the Trump administration's new discounted drug site - CBS News\nWatch CBS News\nPresident Trump's new\nTrumpRx online platform\nis a key part of his plan to help lower drug costs for consumers, with some polls showing two-thirds of Americans report high health care costs as their\u00a0 chief financial concern .\u00a0 Here's what to know about TrumpRx, which launched Thursday and which the White House\nsaid\nin a fact sheet will provide \"immediate relief\" to patients across the U.S. \u00a0 What is TrumpRx? The White House said\nTrumprx.gov \u00a0gives consumers \"direct access to dramatically lower prices\" on dozens of commonly used medications. The website doesn't let users buy drugs directly, but rather directs people to drugmakers' sites, where they can fill their prescriptions.\u00a0 TrumpRx notes it only \"displays discounted drug pricing offers\" and does not sell medication directly to consumers.\u00a0 \"It's a portal where someone can check if they can find a cheaper price, direct-to-consumer, from a drug manufacturer,\" Kaye Pestaina, vice president and director of KFF's patient and consumer protections program, told CBS News. \"It's not a storefront.\"\u00a0 To purchase a discounted medication, TrumpRx tells users to follow the instructions for each drug offer on the platform. Who can use TrumpRx? Anyone can use TrumpRx, provided they have a prescription. For now, however, the platform doesn't accept insurance and is limited to patients who buy medications out of their own pocket.\n\"At this time, TrumpRx discounted pricing is only available for cash-paying patients,\" the platform notes. As a result, spending on drugs through TrumpRx won't count toward a consumer's insurance deductible. Still, cheaper, direct-to-consumer options could benefit uninsured Americans, people with high deductibles and patients whose medications aren't covered by their insurance. \u00a0 \"You should not be buying drugs anymore, going forward, without at least checking to see if those medications are available at these discounted prices,\" Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Thursday.\nBy contrast, Pestaina noted that consumers might also be able to find lower drug prices through their own health insurance. \"It might be a good thing for some people, but for most folks they are paying less through insurance,\" she said. Exceptions to that might include GLP-1 medications for weight loss, where TrumpRX could lead to savings, Pestaina noted. \"Your employer might not cover these kinds of drugs, or there could be limitations.\" For example, the White House fact sheet said TrumpRx offers\nNovo Nordisk's Wegovy\npills for as little as $149 a month, down from $1,349. Consumers can also realize major savings on drugs used to treat infertility, according to the Trump administration.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has urged Congress to pass\n\"The Great Healthcare Plan,\"\nwhich he introduced in January to lower health insurance costs. The proposal would \"enable coverage of TrumpRx.gov purchases under health plans\" and reduce medical insurance costs, according to the White House. What drugs are offered?\u00a0 Consumers can currently access\n43 different drugs \u00a0through TrumpRx for a range of conditions. For instance, users seeking fertility drugs can get an 83% discount on Gonal F, a medication containing a follicle-stimulating hormone, according to the platform.\u00a0 \"Fertility drug pricing could benefit a lot of people, because they aren't typically covered by insurance, and TrumpRx offers discounts,\" Merith Basey, CEO of Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, a patient advocacy group, told CBS News. Late last year, the White House\nstruck deals\nwith more than a dozen drugmakers to participate in the coupon-like program, including AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly Genentech, Merck, Pfizer, and others.\nThe White House said it plans to strike deals with more drugmakers, expanding the list of discounted drugs available through TrumpRx. The 43 drugs on offer, along with the advertised discounts: Abrilada pen (autoimmune) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $207.60 Airsupra (respiratory) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $201 Azulfidine Tabs (rheumatology) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $99.60 Azulfidine En Tabs (rheumatology) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $130.80 Bevespi (respiratory) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $51 Cetrotide (IVF) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $22.50 Chantix (smoking cessation) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $106.20 Cleocin (antibiotic) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $94.35 Colestid (cholesterol) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $127.91 Cortef (inflammation) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $45 Cytomel (thyroid) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $6 Diflucan (antifungal) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $14.06 Duavee (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $30.30 Estring (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $249 Eucrisa (dermatologic) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $158.48 Farxiga (diabetes, cardiovascular) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $181.59 Genotropin (human growth hormone) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $89.67 Gonal F (fertility) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $168 Insulin Lispro (high blood sugar) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $25 Levoxyl (hypothyroidism) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $35.10 Lopid (cholesterol) \u2014TrumpRx price: $39.60 Medrol (inflammation) \u2014TrumpRx price: $3.15 Ngenla (human growth hormone) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $2,217 Nicotrol (smoking cessation) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $271.16 Ovidrel (fertility) \u2014TrumpRx price: $84 Ozempic Pen (diabetes, weight loss) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $199 Premarin (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $99 Premarin Vaginal Cream (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $236.65 Prempro (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $98.84 Pristiq (antidepressant) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $200.10\u00a0 Protonix (heartburn) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $200.10 Tikosyn (cardiovascular) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $336 Toviaz (bladder control) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $43.50 Vfend (antifungal) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $306.98 Viracept (antiviral) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $607.20 Wegovy (weight loss) \u2014 Pen TrumpRx price: $199 Wegovy Pill (weight loss) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $149 Xeljanz (rheumatology) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $1,518 Xigduo Xr (diabetes) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $181.59 Zarontin (anticonvulsant) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $71.10 Zavzpret (migraine treatment) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $594.84 Zepbound (weight loss, sleep apnea) \u2014 TrumpRx price $299 Zyvox (antibiotic) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $122.74\nEdited by\nAlain\nSherter\nMore from CBS News\nWhite House launches TrumpRx discounted drug site\nTrump Accounts to get their own Super Bowl ad.

Julie Le, who is listed as an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security, was assigned to Minnesota to support the Department of Justice in immigration cases after a wave of lawsuits followed mass arrests under\nDonald Trump\u2019s sweeping deportation efforts in the state. That detail is now \u201cover,\u201d\nThe Independent\nhas learned. The episode reveals the mounting frustrations among government attorneys that rarely boil over in public but are now beginning to spill out in courtrooms, where judges are increasingly\nfiring off warning signs\nabout the Trump administration\u2019s legal barrage. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks,\u201d said Le, according to a transcript from Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cAnd I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.\u201d open image in gallery A government lawyer detailed to the US Attorney\u2019s office in Minnesota has been removed from her post after breaking down in court and saying she wants to be held in contempt so she can get \u201824 hours of sleep\u2019\n( AFP via Getty Images ) A federal judge hauled government attorneys to his courtroom Tuesday to find out why ICE\nfailed to comply with several court orders\nto swiftly release wrongly detained immigrants whose cases appeared on his docket. District Judge Jerry R. Blackwell wanted to hear from the government why he shouldn\u2019t be holding officials in contempt for their \u201calarming\u201d failures. Instead, the judge heard from a lawyer who appeared to be at a breaking point. \u201cSometime I wish you would just hold me in contempt, your honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep,\u201d Le told the judge. According to court records, Le has been named as the government\u2019s attorney on more than 80 immigration cases in the state since the beginning of the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Metro Surge. Le told the judge she is simply \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the number of legal challenges from Trump\u2019s mass deportation dragnet. \u201cI am here to make sure the agency understands how important it is to comply with court orders,\u201d said Le, who reportedly appeared visibly upset during the hearing. She said it was like \u201cpulling teeth\u201d to get the Homeland Security and the Justice Department to follow court orders. In a statement to\nThe Independent , the Justice Department denied allegations that ICE isn\u2019t following court orders and blamed judges for \u201coverwhelming\u201d their own courts by failing to prepare them. The Trump administration is \u201ccomplying with court orders and fully enforcing federal immigration law\u201d after \u201cfour years of de facto amnesty\u201d under Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, a spokesperson told\nThe Independent. \u201cIf rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the government\u2019s obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn\u2019t be an \u2018overwhelming\u2019 habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe level of illegal aliens currently detained is a direct result of this Administration\u2019s strong border security policies to keep the American people safe,\u201d the person added. open image in gallery Trump\u2019s Justice Department has pushed out dozens of career prosecutors and other staff who refused to take up politically charged cases, according to watchdog groups\n( REUTERS ) Le is among several government lawyers who appear to have been forced from their jobs after frank admissions in court hearings against the Trump administration. Last year, the Justice Department\nfired an attorney\nwho the Trump administration accused of sabotaging its case against Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken removal from the United States to his home country ignited\na still-ongoing legal battle over his return and deportation. Erez Reuveni was initially placed on administrative leave last year after he expressed frustration with the government\u2019s inability to respond to the court\u2019s questions about Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and admitted that \u201che should not have been sent to El Salvador.\u201d Asked why the government could not simply ask El Salvador to return him, Reuveni replied: \u201cThe first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question.\u201d Dozens of other career prosecutors across the country were forced out over their refusals to drop cases or under pressure to bring politically charged prosecutions against the president\u2019s perceived enemies and longtime foes. At least five Trump-appointed U.S. Attorneys have resigned over political interference from the Trump administration, including prosecutors in Manhattan who were pressured to drop a case against former Mayor Eric Adams and a U.S. attorney in Virginia tasked with prosecuting New York Attorney General Letitia James. Last year, roughly 10,000 attorneys worked across the Justice Department and its components, including the FBI. The Trump administration has fired, forced out, or offered buyouts to roughly 5,500 attorneys and other Justice Department employees, according to Justice Connection, an advocacy group that has tracked departures. Meanwhile, top federal prosecutors in Minnesota\nare fleeing the office over mounting frustrations with the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration agenda. At least eight more career prosecutors are leaving the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Minnesota \u2014 one month after several others resigned\nunder pressure from the Justice Department to investigate the widow of Renee Good,\nwho was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last month. Veteran prosecutor Joseph Thompson, who was previously appointed by Trump to serve as Minnesota\u2019s acting U.S. attorney and first assistant U.S. attorney, among at least six prosecutors who left last month. Thompson reportedly objected to the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to investigate Good\u2019s killing as a civil rights matter and was outraged by an alleged demand to pursue a criminal investigation into Good, according to people familiar with the matter who spoked to\nThe New York Times.

Julie Le had been working for the Justice Department on a detail, but the U.S. attorney in Minnesota ended her assignment after her comments in court on Tuesday, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. She had been working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before the temporary assignment. At a hearing Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, for several immigration cases, Le told U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell that she wishes he could hold her in contempt of court \"so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.\" \"What do you want me to do?

Le's extraordinary remarks reflect the intense strain that has been placed on the federal court system since President Trump returned to the White House a year ago with a promise to carry out mass deportations.\nICE officials have said the surge in Minnesota has become its largest-ever immigration operation\nsince ramping up in early January.\nSeveral\nprosecutors have left\nthe U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota amid frustration with the immigration enforcement surge and the Justice Department's response to\nfatal shootings of two civilians by federal agents .\u00a0 A second wave of departures hit the Minnesota office in recent days, including prosecutors who spearheaded a $250 million fraud case. An office that saw 70 assistant U.S. attorneys during the Biden administration now has\nas few as 17.\nLe was assigned at least 88 cases in less than a month, according to online court records.\nBlackwell told Le that the volume of cases isn't an excuse for disregarding court orders. He expressed concern that people arrested in immigration enforcement operations are routinely jailed for days after judges have ordered their release from custody. \"And I hear the concerns about all the energy that this is causing the DOJ to expend, but, with respect, some of it is of your own making by not complying with orders,\" the judge told Le. Le said she was working for the Department of Homeland Security as an ICE attorney in immigration court before she \"stupidly\" volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota. She arrived on Jan. 5 and told the judge that she wasn't properly trained for the assignment.\n\"We have no guidance or direction on what we need to do,\" Le said.\u00a0 In one instance, the court had ordered a man's unconditional release, but Blackwell said he learned the government had imposed conditions that were not part of the court order. Le said trying to get it fixed was like \"pulling teeth.\" She said she wanted to resign from the job but couldn't get a replacement. \"Fixing a system, a broken system, I don't have a magic button to do it. I don't have the power or the voice to do it,\" Le said. Le and spokespeople for DHS, ICE and the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Kira Kelley, an attorney who represented two petitioners at the hearing, said the flood of immigration petitions is necessary because \"so many people being detained without any semblance of a lawful basis.\" \"And there's no indication here that any new systems or bolded emails or any instructions to ICE are going to fix any of this,\" she added.\nRead the full transcript below:\nJulie Le Court Transcript\nPage\nof\nIn:\nImmigration\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\nMinnesota\nDonald Trump\nPolitics\nSt. Paul\nMinneapolis\nFeatured Local Savings\nU.S. attorney exodus could impact Minnesota fraud investigations\nHow the U.S. attorney exodus could impact Minnesota fraud investigations\n02:20\nHow the U.S. attorney exodus could impact Minnesota fraud investigations\n(02:20)\nView CBS News In\nCBS News App\nOpen\nChrome\nSafari\nContinue", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/ice-lawyer-julie-le-this-job-sucks-minneapolis/", "title": "ICE lawyer removed from Minnesota immigration detail after ..."}}, {"text": "Student loan borrowers in default now able to keep tax refunds Skip to main content\nHome Personal Finance Cars Investing Retirement Lottery Shopping Tax Season Consumer Recalls Careers Coupons Cryptocurrency Real Estate Housing Market Embracing AI\nStudent loan borrowers in default now able to keep tax refunds Susan Tompor\nDetroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nStudent loan borrowers may face wage garnishment Millions of Americans in default on their federal student loans could soon see their wages garnished, as the U.S. Department of Education moves to restart aggressive collections. Fox - 5 Atlanta The U.S. Department of Education announced that it will delay implementing involuntary collections on federal student loans. The National Consumer Law Center said Friday's announcement \"throws a lifeline to working and middle class families.\" Student loan borrowers who are in default now have some good news when it comes to debt collection. The U.S. Department of Education announced Friday, Jan. 16, that it will delay implementing involuntary collections on federal student loans, including administrative wage garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program. It's unclear, based on the\nEducation Department's statement,\nhow long the temporary delay will last. More details will likely be ahead. It's a temporary delay, but it might help ease some worries about whether you'd immediately lose your tax refund to debt collection as the\n2026 tax season approaches. In case you missed it:\nHow seniors can boost tax refunds with new deduction on 2025 returns This tax season is expected to provide sizable refunds to many people, which could drive consumer spending and keep the economy growing. But millions of student loan borrowers in default risked seeing their wages garnished and tax refunds seized, as the long forbearance program that began during the COVID-19 pandemic unwinds and debt collection involving tax refunds and wages resumed. The change comes after much political heat from advocacy groups, including an urgent letter sent in January to the Education Department calling for a delay to avoid what groups called \"an unprecedented default crisis\" ahead. Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, said in a statement Friday that the Trump administration's earlier plan would have been \"economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt.\" \u201cAfter months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people\u2019s hard-earned money directly from their paychecks and tax refunds simply for falling behind on their student loans,\" said Canchola Ba\u00f1ez of Protect Borrowers, formerly called the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit advocacy organization. The National Consumer Law Center said Friday's announcement \"throws a lifeline to working and middle class families.\" Abby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said student loan borrowers are \"buckling under the weight of outdated student loan policies that don\u2019t reflect today\u2019s high cost of living and affordability crisis.\" She said existing policies and protections were set decades ago and have not been updated to reflect how much money people need to live on, given the sizable increases in prices and the cost of living. For example, Shafroth said, the Education Department protects only the first $217.50 per week in wages from garnishment, an amount set in 2009. Similarly, she said, the Education Department protects only the first $750 per month of Social Security benefits from seizure, a protection set in 1996. This summer, the Education Department had paused a plan to resume garnishing Social Security benefits. Without reform, she said, \"turning on collection, largely paused since 2020, would therefore put working families and older adults who fall behind on student loans at risk of being pushed into poverty by the federal government.\" Reforms, Shafroth said, should include increasing the amount of income protected for basic needs set decades ago to reflect today\u2019s much higher cost of living. According to the Education Department, the temporary delay announced Jan. 16 gives the department more time to implement major student loan repayment reforms under the Working Families Tax Cuts Act, which passed last year. And that should give borrowers more options to repay their loans to avoid debt collection. The changes include simplifying repayment options and providing an additional opportunity for borrowers to rehabilitate their federal student loans. The Working Families Act \"reduces the number of federal student loan repayment plans, eliminating a confusing maze of options and making it easier for borrowers to select either a single standard repayment plan or income-driven repayment plan that best meets their needs,\" according to the Education Department. A new income-driven repayment plan waives unpaid interest for borrowers with on-time payments whose payments do not fully cover accrued interest, the Education Department said, and that includes small matching payments from the Education Department in certain circumstances to ensure that outstanding principal is reduced each month. The new plan will be available for borrowers beginning July 1, 2026, the Education Department said. \"The delay in collections will give defaulted borrowers additional time to evaluate these new repayment options once they consolidate their loans or complete a repayment or rehabilitation agreement.\" Under the act, borrowers now have a second chance to rehabilitate a defaulted loan, allowing them to get their repayments back on track and get the loan out of default. Prior to passage of the act, the law permitted borrowers only a single shot at rehabilitation. \"The delay in collections will give defaulted borrowers additional time to begin the rehabilitation process, including the ability to rehabilitate their loan a second time,\" the Education Department said. During the delay, the department is encouraging borrowers in default to explore their options for resolving their defaulted student loans with the defaulted federal loan servicer. The department is continuing to report student loan defaults to credit reporting agencies, the Education Department said, which may adversely impact borrower credit reports. Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert and author, noted that federal income tax refunds were last offset\u00a0for defaulted federal student loans\u00a0in 2019, prior to the pandemic. About 1.4 million federal income tax refunds were offset then, he said, about 15.2% of the total number of defaulted borrowers. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was passed by Congress on March 25, 2020, suspended enforced collections for the duration of the payment pause. And there were further extensions to the payment pause. Kantrowitz estimates that almost 11 million borrowers will be in default by the end of March 2026. By his estimate, some 1.6 million borrowers likely would have had their federal income tax refunds offset. \"But, it could be more,\" he said. \"The federal government usually offsets the full income tax refund amount,\" Kantrowitz said. \"The only exception is when less than the full amount is needed to satisfy the defaulted federal student loan debt.\" Contact\u00a0personal finance columnist Susan Tompor:\u00a0 stompor@freepress.com .\u00a0Follow he r\non X @tompor.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail Share your feedback\nto help improve our site!", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2026/01/22/student-loan-collections-paused/88299000007/", "title": "Student loan borrowers in default now able to keep tax refunds"}}, {"text": "Student loans: Defaulted borrowers risk 2026 tax refunds Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Key Points The Trump administration is predicting larger tax refunds for the 2026 season due to changes in the \"big beautiful bill,\" but the millions of student loan borrowers who are behind on their payments may miss out.

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds\u00a0 $1.6 trillion . Defaulted borrowers still have time to take steps to protect their tax refunds this year, experts say. Here's what to know.\nLearn if your tax refund is at risk\nBorrowers worried about the fate of their tax refund should first make sure they know exactly how far behind they are, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. \"You are not subject to collections unless your debt is actually in default,\" Nierman said. \" Borrowers may think they are in default , but you have to miss at least nine months of payments before your loans are moved to this status.\" You can log into your account at\nStudentaid.gov\nto see how far behind you are; a pink banner on your dashboard may show up if your debt has officially reached default.\n\"If you are delinquent but not yet in default, explore all your repayment options,\" Nierman said. \"You may\nbe eligible for a more affordable payment plan based on your income.\" Enrolling in a forbearance or deferment should also stave off collection activity for a period, she added.\nIf you do learn that you're in default, contact the government's\nTreasury Offset Program's call center\nat\u00a01-800-304-3107, said Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\nBorrowers in default \"need to call right before they file their taxes,\" Taylor said.\nThe government generates a list of people who are in debt to different agencies and may have their tax refunds garnished. You'll be asked to provide your Social Security number to learn if you are on the list, Taylor said.\n\"If their name is not on the list, they're likely in the clear,\" she said.\nIf you are on the list for garnishment, you'll want to take steps right away to get current on your loans \u2014 and ideally before you file your taxes, Taylor said.\nGet current on student loans before filing taxes Getting current on your student loans or taking steps to do so may stop the government from seizing your tax refund. But it can take between 30 days and 10 months to get out of default, so some borrowers may consider\nrequesting an extension to file their tax return , Taylor said. Doing so is easy and free, and automatically extends your deadline to file federal taxes from April 15 to Oct. 15. (Borrowers who aren't sure if they'll owe taxes or receive a refund may benefit from\npreparing a mock return\nbefore the April 15 deadline. \"Filing an extension does not extend the time to pay taxes owed,\" said Kathleen Boyd, a certified financial planner and founder of Student Loan Savvy. If you do have a tax obligation, you'll need to pay by the original deadline to avoid incurring interest and penalties, she said.) You are not subject to collections unless your debt is actually in default. Nancy Nierman assistant director at EDCAP\nApplying for a loan consolidation\nis typically the fastest way to get out of default, Taylor said. The process can be completed in as little as four weeks, she added. But some defaulted borrowers may be required to make several on-time payments before they can consolidate, and not all borrowers will qualify, including some who've already consolidated their loans or are facing wage garnishment.\nConsolidating your loans, which involves repackaging your federal student debts into a new federal student loan, can also lead you to lose progress on your forgiveness timeline under some repayment plans, Taylor said.\nBorrowers may also lose out on current repayment options\nif the consolidation wraps up after June, due to Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"\nAnother way to get out of default is through\na loan rehabilitation . That process involves making \"nine voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments,\" according to the U.S. Department of Education. Those nine payments can be made over \"a period of 10 consecutive months,\" it notes on the StudentAid.gov site. If you can't finish the agreement before filing your taxes, you can try contacting your loan servicer and asking if they'll stop collection anyway, Taylor said. They may agree to do so if you start rehabilitation not long after receiving a notice of default or if you've already made five rehabilitation payments.\nAfter taking these steps, Taylor recommends calling the Treasury hotline back before submitting your taxes. If your name is no longer on the garnishment list, you can file with more peace of mind.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/student-loans-default-tax-refunds-garnishment.html", "title": "Student loans: Defaulted borrowers risk 2026 tax refunds - CNBC"}}, {"text": "Bad Bunny\u2019s halftime show \u2013 What it means for Puerto Rico Skip to main content\nHome Movies Celebrities TV Music Books Broadway Theatre Crosswords Games Entertain This!

The NFL's Bad Bunny pick for the Super Bowl halftime show was likely not politically motivated. USA TODAY's Pamela Avila explains. For three hours last summer, Wilfredo Jos\u00e9 Burgos-Matos felt like he didn\u2019t have to leave Puerto Rico again after moving away from the island 11 years ago. Bad Bunny\u2019s residency\nin San Juan last August hit Burgos-Matos like a wave of nostalgia, from the plena-style rhythm mixed with reggaeton and salsa filling \"El Choli\" coliseum to the pink casita and mountains built for the stage, bringing him back to his hometown of Aibonito, Puerto Rico.\u00a0 \u201cIt just very honestly made me kind of realize, or even dream a little bit, about staying and not having to live again and go through this diaspora mourning, or this grief of always being in constant movement outside of the island,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of a gift that that Bad Bunny gave to Puerto Ricans.\u201d Now,\nBad Bunny\nis bringing that same energy to one of the biggest global stages this weekend: the\nApple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show . Bad Bunny has repeatedly centered Puerto Rico in his music and his career, including his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d and his recent 31-date\n\u201cNo Me Quiero Ir de Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency\nin San Juan that generated millions into the island\u2019s local economy. Bad Bunny, whose name is\nBenito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio , has hinted his performance will be about unity during the trailer for the halftime show, where he danced with people from various ages and from diverse backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.\u00a0 But it will also, undoubtedly, be about Puerto Rico. \u201cBenito speaks first and foremost to Puerto Ricans, and so he doesn't really care what other people think, and I think that's part of the formula for his success,\u201d said Jorell Mel\u00e9ndez-Badillo, associate professor of Latin American and Caribbean History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Bad Bunny leans into Puerto Rican pride Over the past decade, Bad Bunny has skyrocketed to one of the world's biggest superstars, going from a local supermarket bagboy-turned-SoundCloud-rapper to the\nmost streamed artist across the globe . Through it all, he\u2019s leaned into his Puerto Ricanness.\u00a0 Boricua slang like perreo (a type of dance linked to reggaeton music), janguear (to hang out) and bichiyal (a stylish woman) are sprinkled throughout many of Bad Bunny\u2019s songs. He's worn a pava, a traditional Puerto Rican straw hat, on red carpets and in the promo for the Super Bowl. He highlighted the struggles Puerto Ricans experienced on the island following the devastating back-to-back hurricanes, including Hurricane Maria, in 2017, during a\ndocumentary-style music video\nfor his hit, \u201cEl Apagon.\u201d He\u2019s highlighted the ongoing gentrification in Puerto Rico, including in his song \u201cLo Que Le Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d on his latest album.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you have a Puerto Rican, like Bad Bunny, appear on this massive platform, it is some sort of a reminder to viewers that Puerto Rico exists,\u201d said Burgos-Matos, a Caribbean music academic. \u201cThat Puerto Ricans are not just consumers of U.S. culture or passive participants of the U.S.\u201d The rapper has also boosted\ntourism to the island . His residency last summer alone brought in estimates of\n$200 million\nto more than\n$700 million\nto Puerto Rico.\u00a0 Bad Bunny shines a light on Puerto Rico\u2019s history But Boricuas in the United States and on the island are hoping that viewers of the halftime show will do more than just Google tickets to visit the island. Instead, some are hoping it will shine a light on the island\u2019s deep history \u2013 and its complicated relationship with the United States. Burgos-Matos, who left Puerto Rico more than a decade ago to further his education and now has a doctorate, currently lives in the Bronx, \u201can extension of Puerto Rico,\u201d he said. His journey is one that many in the diaspora take.\u00a0 Roughly 5.8 million Puerto Ricans live in the United States, according to\nPew Research Center . Another 3.2 million live on the island, which is a U.S. territory, according to\nthe U.S. Census Bureau .\u00a0 \u201cThere is a lot of trauma that Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans have been enduring for the past years with, not only with the ongoing colonial status, but also the economic crisis, the mass migration, the unpayable debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThis\u2026is a form of asserting some sort of cultural survival.\u201d Mikey Cordero, an artist living in Santurce, Puerto Rico, a neighborhood in the island\u2019s capitol, said that Puerto Rico often \u201cgets pushed to the side\u201d politically and in media.\u00a0 Specifically, Cordero hopes the performance will open a conversation about \u201ccolonization\u201d and how laws in place, like the Jones Act, affect Puerto Rico\u2019s economy. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated U.S. territory, and has long been the subject of the debate on whether the island should become a state or an independent country.\u00a0 \u201cHe's giving you breadcrumbs into the Puerto Rican experience,\u201d Cordero, 42, said. \u201cI think if it brings more attention and more eyes on our story and our fight and our struggle \u2013 that's what I think even Bad Bunny wants \u2013 for you to like walk away with, to have that sense of prioritizing the Puerto Rican story.\u201d 'The more local Bad Bunny gets, the more universal he becomes' Puerto Rico\u2019s story is a relatable one.\u00a0 And some Boricuas anticipate that people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds won\u2019t feel excluded. Instead, they\u2019ll feel seen. Mel\u00e9ndez-Badillo, who collaborated with Bad Bunny by writing historical narratives for videos for the artist\u2019s latest record, said the reggaeton superstar explores themes around displacement, gentrification, and longing for home. \u201cThose are things that people can connect with regardless if they're from Puerto Rico or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the things that people from the Global South have been dealing with for a long time.\u201d D\u00e1maris Otero-Torres, an associate professor at Rutgers University\nwho is teaching a class on the Puerto Rican star, said Bad Bunny\u2019s message in his music is universal and can create solidarity, even as he makes \u201csure that people understand the richness of Puerto Rico and all the things that it has to be, not only the U.S. and its community, but the world.\u201d Him being chosen as an artist who sings and speaks almost entirely in Spanish is also a political act, Otero-Torres said, especially at a time in the United States where she says knowing another language is seen as a \u201cliability.\u201d \u201cWhy can't you open yourself to learn of the richness of the vastness of the culture? \u2026 The United States is an incredible melting pot,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeaking another language is not a liability. It enriches you.\u00a0It allows you not only to understand other cultures, but to understand your own culture in deeper ways.\u201d The more local Bad Bunny gets, the more universal he becomes, Otero-Torres, who is from the R\u00edo Piedras neighborhood in San Juan, recalled reading recently.\u00a0 \u201cI think that's true,\u201d she said.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail Share your feedback\nto help improve our site!", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2026/02/06/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-puerto-rico-impact/88302878007/", "title": "What Bad Bunny\u2019s halftime show means for Puerto Rico"}}, {"text": "MSN", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/super-bowl-lx-to-be-played-in-heart-of-silicon-valley-where-pears-sprouted-before-microprocessors/ar-AA1VBIdk", "title": "Super Bowl LX to be played in heart of Silicon Valley, where ..."}}, {"text": "Donald Trump - Wikipedia\nJump to content\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nPresident of the United States (2017\u20132021; since 2025)\n\"Trump\" redirects here.

By choosing to endorse Schlossberg, the grandson of John F. Kennedy and a prominent millennial voice, Pelosi is using her influence in a bid to shape the future of the Democratic Party. Pelosi, who is set to retire from Congress, holds a unique stance in this Democratic primary, where establishment backing is fiercely contested. Her decision to dive into the fray, especially for a member of the Kennedy family, underscores the enduring legacy and influence of the Kennedy brand in American politics. \u201cThis is a consequential moment for the country\u2014faith in our politics is fractured and trust in government is tenuous,\u201d stated Pelosi, emphasizing the need for genuine leadership. Who is Jack Schlossberg? Jack Schlossberg, 33, has emerged as an intriguing figure in the political arena. With his education from Harvard and Yale, he possesses the credentials but lacks the extensive political track record that many institutions typically value. Yet, he is not unfamiliar with the spotlight, thanks to his social media presence where he tackles contemporary issues with a blend of humor and seriousness. Social Media Influencer: Schlossberg has gained traction online, discussing a myriad of topics from mental health to political commentary. Family Legacy: His connections run deep; his mother, Caroline Kennedy, served as ambassador under both President Obama and President Biden. Political Background: While he may be viewed as an outsider, the Kennedy legacy acts as both a shield and a sword in this race. The Landscape of the Democratic Primary The Democratic primary for New York's 12th district includes a host of candidates vying for the position left vacant by Jerry Nadler. Among them are: Micah Lasher, a close ally of Nadler. Jami Floyd, an influential journalist. Alex Bores, a state assembly member. George Conway, the Republican-turned-Democrat attorney. Schlossberg's appeal lies not just in his heritage but also in his ability to resonate with younger voters\u2014an imperative demographic for the future of the party. His critical perspective on social issues positions him as a refreshing choice amid a largely seasoned political field. The Implications of an Endorsement Pelosi's endorsement serves a dual purpose: it bolsters Schlossberg's campaign while amplifying her own brand of leadership as one willing to disrupt norms for progressive change. By stepping into the primary debates, she seeks to demonstrate that the party is open to new ideas without sacrificing its foundational values. \u201cA candidacy rooted in understanding issues and delivering for the people is what we need now,\u201d Pelosi remarked, framing the current political moment. Historic Dynamics and Future Prospects As Schlossberg throws his hat into the political ring, the dynamics of family legacy versus individual merit will be a central theme of his campaign. Historically, the Kennedy name has been synonymous with progressivism, drawing both admiration and skepticism. This election cycle, with growing apathy toward traditional politics, Schlossberg's engagement will be tested. Will he capitalize on the goodwill of his family's legacy to forge a space for new, innovative policies? Or will his lack of a conventional political record be a stumbling block? A Call for Accountability Ultimately, Pelosi's endorsement of Schlossberg is more than an affirmation of his candidacy; it's a call for accountability in governance. The urgency expressed in her remarks reflects broader concerns about the political disillusionment felt by constituents across the nation. As we navigate this electoral cycle, the implications of such high-profile endorsements will significantly impact Democratic strategies moving forward. In a time when political trust hangs by a thread, leaders like Pelosi and candidates like Schlossberg must bridge the gap between legacy and new-age reforms. The stakes could not be higher.

Kennedy, for New York's 12th Congressional District. The endorsement, confirmed during a campaign event on Sunday, bolsters Schlossberg's position in a crowded Democratic primary. Pelosi's support highlights Democratic efforts to harness the Kennedy legacy amid 2026 midterm preparations. Pelosi Announces Formal Endorsement at Campaign Event Nancy Pelosi, the influential former Speaker of the\nUS\nHouse of Representatives, delivered her endorsement of Jack Schlossberg during a joint appearance at a New York campaign venue on February 8, 2026. The event, attended by over 500 supporters, union representatives, and Democratic operatives, marked Pelosi's first major primary intervention since retiring from leadership. Schlossberg, standing alongside Pelosi, thanked her for the backing, calling it a pivotal moment for his campaign. In her remarks, Pelosi emphasised Schlossberg's potential to unite voters in the district encompassing Manhattan's Upper West Side, Midtown, and landmarks like the United Nations. She stated that his candidacy addresses the \"fractured trust in government\" following recent national elections. The endorsement release, distributed to media outlets, included quotes from Pelosi praising Schlossberg's\n\"fresh perspective rooted in public service.\"\nMultiple wire services, including Associated Press and Reuters, carried live updates from the event. Political commentators reacted swiftly to the initial New York Times reporting that broke the story on February 7. Mark Halperin said in X post,\n\u201cPelosi to Endorse Jack Schlossberg, Again Backing a Kennedy for Congress https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/07/us/politics/pelosi-endorse-schlossberg-kennedy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share via @NYTimes.\u201d Pelosi's speech lasted 15 minutes, during which she recounted her own family's political history and parallels with the Kennedys. She noted her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., mayor of Baltimore, had campaigned for JFK in 1960. The crowd responded with sustained applause, and video footage showed Schlossberg embracing Pelosi at the conclusion. Campaign staff reported immediate boosts in online donations following the livestream. Jack Schlossberg's Campaign Launch and Momentum Jack Schlossberg announced his candidacy on November 12, 2025, via a video filmed against the New York City skyline. The 33-year-old Harvard Law graduate positioned himself as a \"new generation leader\" focused on housing affordability, climate action, and expanding healthcare access. Federal Election Commission filings from January 2026 show his campaign raised $3.2 million in the first quarter, surpassing initial challengers. Donors included Kennedy family friends, tech entrepreneurs, and progressive nonprofits. Schlossberg grew up in the 12th District, attending local schools before Yale University and Harvard. His resume includes a stint as a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, clerking for a federal judge, and brief journalism at Vogue magazine. He served as a US Senate page and interned for John Kerry during Kerry's presidential bid. Public records confirm his voter registration in the district since 2015. The candidate has cultivated a social media presence with over 1.2 million followers across platforms. Content includes policy discussions, fitness routines, and tributes to his grandfather JFK. A January 2026 paddleboarding video on the Hudson River garnered 500,000 views, blending personal appeal with calls for infrastructure investment. Analytics from campaign trackers indicate 70% positive sentiment in district polls post-launch. District Profile and Nadler's Retirement Impact New York's 12th Congressional District covers 14% of Manhattan's population, including affluent areas like the Upper West Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Chelsea. Redrawn after the 2020 census, it leans Democratic by a 40-point margin in presidential races. Key issues include high rents averaging $4,200 monthly, transit delays on the 1 train, and commercial real estate pressures near Times Square. Voter turnout reached 72% in 2024, above state averages. The seat became open when Representative Jerry Nadler, 78, announced retirement on September 15, 2025, after 32 years in Congress. Nadler, who led\nTrump\nimpeachment proceedings, endorsed Micah Lasher, his former counsel and New York State official. Nadler cited health reasons and a desire for \"renewed energy\" in his valedictory statement. His departure triggered a filing rush, with eight Democrats entering by the January deadline. District demographics show 65% white, 15% Asian, 10% Hispanic residents, with median income over $150,000. Recent zoning debates over luxury towers and green space preservation dominate community board meetings. Schlossberg's team has attended 25 such forums since launch, distributing literature on rent stabilisation. Crowded Democratic Primary Field Details The June 23, 2026, primary features a diverse slate. Micah Lasher, 44, brings government experience from the state attorney general's office. Assemblymember Alex Bores represents the Upper East Side with focuses on education funding. J Floyd, a broadcast journalist, emphasises media literacy and youth outreach. George Conway, 83, leverages his anti-Trump credentials from the Lincoln Project. Other entrants include a labour organiser and tech policy advocate. New York\u2019s closed primary restricts voting to enrolled Democrats, numbering 1.2 million district-wide. Early polls from Siena College place Schlossberg at 28%, Lasher at 22%, with others trailing. Fundraising totals: Schlossberg $3.2m, Lasher $2.1m, Bores $1.4m. The contest draws national donors due to the district's safe general election status. Schlossberg differentiates through family heritage, screening JFK documentaries at house parties. Critics question his thin resume, but supporters cite his articulate debate performances. A January debate at Cooper Union drew 800 attendees, with clips circulating widely. Journalists covering Capitol Hill amplified the endorsement news on social platforms. Nicholas Fandos said in X post,\n\u201cPelosi to Endorse Jack Schlossberg, Again Backing a Kennedy for Congress https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/07/us/politics/pelosi-endorse-schlossberg-kennedy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share via @NYTimes.\u201d Pelosi's Endorsement History with Kennedys Pelosi's support for Schlossberg echoes prior Kennedy endorsements. In 2020, she backed Joe Kennedy III's Massachusetts Senate challenge against Ed Markey, despite the loss. She hosted Caroline Kennedy at fundraising events during her ambassadorships. Pelosi's own dynasty includes five terms as Speaker and leadership of major legislation like the Affordable Care Act. Post-2023, Pelosi chairs advisory boards for super PACs targeting 50 House seats. Her network mobilised $100 million in 2024 cycles. Sources describe her as selective, endorsing only 10% of requested primaries. The Schlossberg pick aligns with youth recruitment drives by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Three Pelosi associates confirmed to media the endorsement brewed since December 2025 phone calls. It overrides quieter backing for Lasher from some unions. Republican strategists view the race as non-competitive but monitor for spillover enthusiasm. Schlossberg's Policy Positions and Public Engagements Schlossberg's platform includes codifying Roe v. Wade federally, $15 billion for commuter rail upgrades, and tax credits for renters. He proposes a \"Green Manhattan Initiative\" for solar panels on public buildings. At a February 4 housing forum, he pledged opposition to developer incentives without affordability mandates. He distanced from cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., criticising RFK Jr.'s Trump alignment and vaccine views in 2025 X threads. Schlossberg spoke at the 2024 DNC, praising Kamala Harris. His Profile in Courage award acceptance at JFK Library drew parallels to current challenges. Campaign infrastructure boasts 15 field offices, 2,000 volunteers, and weekly canvasses hitting 5,000 doors. Digital ads run on local news sites, emphasising \"Kennedy grit for New York.\" Media buys total $800,000 through February. Broader 2026 Midterm Landscape The 2026 midterms feature 35 Senate races and full House renewal amid President Trump's second term. Democratic retirements exceed 20, creating open seats. National trends show crowded primaries in California, Florida, and Pennsylvania. Ranked-choice voting debates surface in several states. New York's delegation faces redistricting after 2024 court rulings. Safe seats like NY-12 allow focus on turnout. GOP challengers in adjacent districts reference Schlossberg as \"celebrity nepotism.\" Democratic unity post-endorsement appears solid, per DNC memos. Voter outreach includes multilingual mailers in Spanish, Mandarin, and Russian, reflecting district diversity. Early voting starts May 2026. Analysts project 85% Democratic hold probability. Event Aftermath and Next Steps Post-endorsement, Schlossberg's war chest\ngrew\nby $750,000 overnight. TV ads debut February 10, featuring Pelosi narration. Primary debates schedule four sessions through May. Filing amendments due March 1. Pelosi plans district visits through spring, coordinating with state party chairs. Schlossberg's ground game targets young voters via campus tables at NYU and Columbia. Metrics show 15% registration spike among 18-34s. The race exemplifies generational shifts, with average candidate age 48 versus Nadler's tenure. Coverage spans CNN, MSNBC, and local outlets like NY1. Fundraising deadlines loom quarterly.

In addition to a count of making threats against the president and successors to the presidency, Mathre is also charged with receipt and distribution of child pornography. On Feb. 6, Mathre pleaded not guilty to the two counts in federal court in Toledo, records show. Magistrate Judge Darrell Clay ordered Mathre temporarily detained until his next hearing on Feb. 11. \u201cWhile arresting this man for allegedly threatening to murder the Vice President of the United States, a serious crime in and of itself, federal law enforcement discovered that he was also in possession of child sexual abuse materials,\u201d Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a\nFeb. 6 statement . In a Feb. 7 email, Neil McElroy, Mathre's lawyer, said he couldn't comment on the second child pornography charge since the government hadn't provided discovery yet. But McElroy called the first charge against Mathre \u2212 of allegedly threatening the vice president \u2212 a \"farce.\" The allegation, he said, \"may buttress the administration's narrative regarding threats of violence aimed at members of the administration.\" Mathre faces up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 for threats against the vice president, prosecutors said. The child pornography charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and up to a $250,000 fine. Vance is an Ohio native who formerly represented the state in the Senate.

The presence of ICE in the city has hurt economic activity.Credit...Yasmin Yassin for The New York TimesFeb. 4, 2026, 11:37 a.m. ET As the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota\ntakes a toll\non local businesses, whose customers and employees are staying off the streets out of fear, some public budgets heads have a message to the White House: Stop. Democratic state treasurers, auditors and comptrollers from 15 states \u2014 including two from California \u2014\nsent a letter\non Wednesday to President Trump calling for a halt to aggressive tactics that they say have depressed economic activity and tax collections. \u201cMany of our states already send more tax dollars to Washington than we receive in federal support,\u201d read the letter, whose signatories also included the fiscal officers of Maryland, Oregon and New York. \u201cWe are now expected to absorb the fiscal consequences of enforcement activities. This is not acceptable.\u201d State fiscal officers do not often weigh in as a group on law enforcement matters. They leave that to attorneys general, who frequently write collective letters and court briefs, typically with members of their own party. The letter was organized by\nFor the Long Term , a group of progressive-leaning state and local financial overseers who aim to foster economic and budgetary stability beyond the rapid churn of election cycles. The signatories said they came together when they determined that what was\nunfolding in Minnesota\ncrossed into their domain as stewards of the public purse. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. Tom Homan, Mr. Trump\u2019s border czar, said on Wednesday that the administration would\nwithdraw 700 immigration agents\nfrom Minnesota, leaving around 2,000 there. Other states have also experienced extended Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence, including Illinois, where Operation Midway Blitz\ntook place in the fall . Mike Frerichs, the state\u2019s treasurer, said sales and income taxes dipped during that period, as people fearing federal officers avoided restaurants and shops in neighborhoods like Chicago\u2019s Little Village. \u201cIf you\u2019re terrorizing people, and they think they\u2019re going to be arrested or shot, they\u2019re going to stay home, and they\u2019re not going to be spending money,\u201d Mr. Frerichs said. \u201cDonald Trump and Stephen Miller may not care about immigrants to this country, but the fear and chaos that they are sowing in our cities are having ripple effects on taxpaying Americans.\u201d Officials from other states are thinking about what might happen if ICE came through in force. \u201cThere\u2019s always concern that our state might be next,\u201d said Mike Pellicciotti, the treasurer of Washington, which has large immigrant communities in both agriculture and technology. He said ICE deployments were just one of several blows from the federal government over the past year, including\ntariffs . \u201cThis reckless economic policy is having an impact across the board,\u201d Mr. Pellicciotti said. \u201cWe\u2019re a trade-dependent state. We\u2019re a state that relies on a talented work force from around the world wanting to come.\u201d Mr. Trump has\nthreatened to withhold funding\nfor Democratic cities and states, including child care subsidies, public housing assistance and food stamps. The White House has also pulled back clean energy and other infrastructure grants, such as $205 million for the $16 billion Gateway project between New York and New Jersey. For state and local finances, the damage from the Trump administration\u2019s immigration restrictions and expanding enforcement efforts might take a while to play out, said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a think tank. Many states, especially in the Northeast and the industrial Midwest, have depended on immigration to keep their populations steady or growing. \u201cBudgets are getting tighter and if the immigration restrictions begin to crimp the tax base \u2014 we\u2019ll see in the next year or two what this looks like in terms of sales tax growth and income tax growth \u2014 then you have reason for concern,\u201d Mr. Glasgall said. The list of signatories included states that received an influx of migrants during the Biden administration, a situation that also had tremendous fiscal costs. They were borne primarily by cities like Denver, whose mayor unsuccessfully\npleaded for federal help\nas he spent tens of millions of dollars to accommodate the new arrivals. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that\nwhile the surge boosted tax revenues\nfor state and local governments, their spending went up by about $10 billion more. State fiscal officers said that current efforts to expel unauthorized immigrants have much wider implications for local economic activity because even legal residents fear being stopped and detained. \u201cAll of a sudden it presents this huge barrier to people participating in their communities,\u201d said Dave Young, Colorado\u2019s treasurer. Plus, he said, immigrants are essential to the state\u2019s work force. \u201cThe concern that I have is that so many of these people that are here performing these tremendous services that we absolutely need, if they leave Colorado put us in a pretty significant economic bind,\u201d he said.

Read Original Article Categories rationale: The article directly discusses the actions of state fiscal officers (treasurers/comptrollers) regarding federal policy (ICE crackdowns) and its impact on state finances, placing it under Jurisdictions (policy interaction) and Political Endorsements/Opposition (policy critique). Level 2 focuses on the cross-jurisdictional policy conflict and the political stance taken by the officials. Characteristics justification: The sentiment is strongly negative (-0.65) due to direct criticism of the administration's actions ('bad for business,' 'terrorizing people,' 'reckless economic policy'). The high uncertainty (0.9) stems from the officials expressing concern about future budget impacts and whether their state might be 'next' for enforcement actions. Tag relevance: The tags focus on the key actors (state treasury officials), the subject of the protest (ICE crackdowns, immigration enforcement), and the primary consequence discussed (tax revenues, economic activity). asset-types: others\nrwa: false\nentropy: 0.75\nsentiment: -0.65\nstaleness: 0.3\nrelevance: 0.1\nuncertainty: 0.9 #tax-revenues #immigration-enforcement #economic-activity #trump-administration #ice-crackdowns #state-treasury-officials #fiscal-consequences #for-the-long-term Full Analysis Share Previous Next Discussion about this post Comments Restacks Top Latest Discussions No posts Ready for more?

The Trump administration has sued to block the law, saying it violates federal powers. Democratic lawmakers in New York, California, Colorado and Oregon are considering similar laws.\nRepublican-led states lean into enforcement\nAfter Trump took office last year, many red states jumped to support the president's mass deportation efforts.\nIn Tennessee, the state\nprovides grants to law enforcement agencies\nthat work with ICE. Since that was passed last year, the number of sheriff's offices and police departments that have\nsigned a formal agreement with ICE\nhas skyrocketed.\nSponsor Message\nNow, Republican lawmakers in the state are considering making that voluntary program involuntary as part of a bigger immigration package.\nKentucky\nlawmakers are moving in the same direction.\nThis year, Tennessee is\npiloting legislation\nmade in partnership with Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, and the White House.\nOne of the policies would make it impossible for someone without legal status to buy a car, earn a nursing certificate or receive any government benefits. (Many government benefits are already off-limits to people living in the country illegally.) \"We're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail\" is how Cameron Sexton, the Republican Tennessee House speaker, explained it when announcing the legislation.\nThe Indiana Senate last week passed a measure that would tighten requirements for local agencies, including universities, to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Last month,\nNew Hampshire\ntook a page out of Tennessee's book by banning sanctuary cities, meaning cities can't impede federal immigration officers from carrying out their duties.\nBlue states limiting ICE cooperation\nSome Democratic-led states are considering\nmask bans or ID requirements\nfor federal agents. California's law on that is currently\ntied up in court .\nIllinois has a law limiting police cooperation with ICE that lawmakers say they want to expand this year. Last week, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul\nannounced legislation\nto do that, too.\nMaine has set up a\ntip line to report\nICE activity and abuses.\nDemocrats in other states, including Massachusetts, are looking at\ncreating \"safe zones\"\naround courthouses, schools, churches and hospitals\nwhere agents are not allowed to make arrests .\nIn a couple of weeks, the Minnesota Legislature will meet for the first time since the ICE surge there. Democrats say they're ready to pass a bill that would enable Minnesotans to sue federal agents, and changes to\nhelp renters\naffected by immigration enforcement avoid eviction.\nSponsor Message\nWhile Democrats control the Minnesota Senate, the state House is split between the two parties, meaning Democrats will need some Republican support to pass any new proposals.\nMawa Iqbal\nis a statehouse reporter for WBEZ and\nMarianna Bacallao\nis the power and equity reporter for WPLN.\nCorrection\nFeb. 3, 2026\nAn\u00a0earlier version of this story misspelled Stephen Miller's\u00a0first\u00a0name\u00a0as Steven.\nimmigration crackdown\nice\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail\nSponsor Message\nSponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.npr.org/2026/02/03/nx-s1-5697380/ice-immigrants-minnesota-state-law", "title": "Red and blue states move further apart on immigration ... - NPR"}}, {"text": "Feinstein Demands Barr Hand Over Whistleblower Report: This Is 'Unacceptable' | HuffPost Latest News\nSkip to Main Content \u00d7 Main Menu U.S. Edition Follow Us Terms \u00a0|\u00a0 Privacy Policy Part of HuffPost Politics. \u00a92026 BuzzFeed, Inc.

LOADING ERROR LOADING Sen.\nDianne Feinstein\n(D-Calif.) is demanding that Attorney General\nWilliam Barr\nrelease a whistleblower report that reportedly sounded the alarm on President\nDonald Trump \u2019s requests for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s help in\nsecuring the 2020 election . \u201cIf media reports are correct that President Trump delayed military aid appropriated by Congress in order to get Ukraine to investigate a political opponent, it\u2019s difficult not to see that as an abuse of presidential authority, plain and simple,\u201d Feinstein \u2015 the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee \u2015 said\nin a statement\nSaturday. Advertisement\nTrump called Zelensky in July and asked him about eight times to assist attorney\nRudy Giuliani\nwith a probe into former Vice President\nJoe Biden \u2019s son, Hunter,\nThe Wall Street Journal\nreported Friday. Trump is said to have believed that it could hamper the elder Biden\u2019s presidential bid. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has been refusing to hand over to Congress an Aug. 12 report from an intelligence officer who flagged Trump\u2019s alleged comments, according to\nThe Washington Post . The outlet reported that the White House legal counsel\u2019s office also is attempting to hide the report from Congress. Feinstein called the\nTrump administration \u2019s defiance \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cThe president is essentially saying that Congress has no right to investigate the executive branch, which is a direct attack on the separation of powers,\u201d she said. \u201cOversight is a constitutional function of Congress.\u201d Advertisement\nThe senator sent a letter to Barr on Friday \u201cdemanding that the whistleblower report be transmitted to Congress, which is required by law,\u201d she said in her statement. Feinstein also wants to know what advice may have been given to Maguire to prompt him to withhold the report. \u201cCovering this up will only make matters worse for this administration,\u201d she said. Feinstein joins a chorus of\nDemocrats\ncalling for the release\nof the report, including Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair\nMark Warner\nof Virginia and House Intelligence Committee Chairman\nAdam Schiff\nof California, who have offered the administration the opportunity to\nclear the matter up\nin the coming days. For several months, Giuliani has tried gin up suspicion surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s past position on the board of Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings, for which he was paid up to $50,000 per month,\nThe New York Times\nreported. Advertisement\nHis board membership \u2015 which began in 2014 and ended in April \u2015 has been a matter of public record for years. His membership overlapped with his father\u2019s tenure as vice president, during which time the elder Biden pushed for the ouster of Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor-general, who was helming a corruption probe into Burisma. According to the Times, during the last year of President\nBarack Obama \u2019s administration, Biden \u201cthreatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine\u2019s leaders did not dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite.\u201d No evidence has emerged, however, that Biden was aware of the Burisma investigation, and Giuliani\u2019s theory remains unfounded. Responding on Friday to Trump\u2019s alleged communication with Zelensky, Biden said if true, it would indicate that \u201cthere is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.\u201d \u201cIt means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation ... to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\u201d Related Donald Trump Politics and Government 2020 election Joe Biden\nRudy Giuliani Donald Trump Is Asking A Foreign Country To Help Him Win.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

The four-year cycle between FIFA World Cups will feature multiple editions of the Concacaf Nations League and the Concacaf Gold Cup, as well as a revamped World Cup Qualifying format. Regarding this important announcement,\u00a0 Concacaf President and FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani said :\u00a0 \u201cOver the past four-plus years, our Confederation has had both the privilege and the responsibility of preparing our members to compete in and host the largest FIFA World Cup in history, a tournament in which a record number of our nations will participate. When the World Cup concludes next summer, an extraordinary chapter of growth and achievement for our region will come to a close, ushering in an exciting new period. As we look ahead, the four-year calendar we have developed ensures that our members can continue to pursue their next goals through consistent elite competition, whether that means earning promotion in the Concacaf Nations League, qualifying for or winning the Concacaf Gold Cup, or ultimately reaching the pinnacle of our sport: the FIFA World Cup. I want to express my sincere gratitude to our 41 Member Associations for their support in shaping and embracing our calendar. This calendar, together with our expanded ecosystems for Senior Women\u2019s National Teams and men\u2019s and women\u2019s club competitions, is truly football-first and will continue to elevate and transform the game across Concacaf.\u201d\nCONCACAF NATIONS LEAGUE The Concacaf Nations League was established by the Confederation in 2018 to provide all member associations with consistent opportunities to compete in official matches throughout the four-year cycle between FIFA World Cups. The competition promotes development and delivers an exciting, region-wide tournament experience for fans.\u00a0 Since its inception, four editions of the Concacaf Nations League have taken place, featuring intense competition for the title of Concacaf Nations League Champion, promotion and relegation across the three leagues, and qualification for major centralized tournaments. The next two Concacaf Nations League editions are scheduled for 2026/27 and 2028/29. They will continue to be played under the existing three-league system and serve as the qualifying pathway to the Concacaf Gold Cup. The composition of each League will be determined based on the results of the preceding edition. Furthermore, starting in 2026/27, the competition will also introduce Finals for Leagues B and C, adding eight additional matches and bringing the total to 118.

For the first time since last year\u2019s war with Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted indirect talks over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. And for the first time, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test, just one day after letting a key nuclear arms treaty with Russia expire. Nick Schifrin reports.\nRead the Full Transcript\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nGeoff Bennett:\nWelcome to the \"News Hour.\" Today, across two continents, the U.S. confronted two very different nuclear challenges. For the first time since last year's war in Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted diplomacy focused on that country's nuclear program.\nAmna Nawaz:\nAnd for the first time today, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test just one day after letting the final nuclear arms control treaty with Russia expire, Nick Schifrin been covering both stories and joins us now. So, Nick, let's start with the U.S. and Iran. What do we know about how those talks went today?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, the Trump administration has provided no readout at the moment, but in the lead-up to these talks, we heard from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the top negotiator, Steve Witkoff, that Iran must not make any nuclear fuel domestically, must restrict the range of its ballistic missiles, must end its support for proxy groups and account for highly enriched uranium that has been missing since last summer's strikes. Today, the U.S. held indirect talks. You see Witkoff there with the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, meeting Oman's foreign minister, who then met with Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who said the talks focused on nuclear weapons and were a -- quote -- \"good start.\"\nAbbas Araghchi, Iranian Foreign Minister:\nWe were able to exchange our viewpoints, to express our concerns and our interests for a possible deal between the two sides on our nuclear question.\nNick Schifrin:\nAraghchi said there would be a new round of talks. No confirmation of that from the U.S. side, which for the first time included the top U.S. military commander from the Middle East, a reminder, Amna, of President Trump's threats against Iran and that military buildup still in the region.\nAmna Nawaz:\nSo what do the experts tell you all of that means for the possibility of an actual deal?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, that's the question I put to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is very skeptical of any deal of Iran's nuclear program, missile program, or support for proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas. Karim Sadjadpour, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: The Iranian regime still seems so intent on defying the United States and they fear that if they give into pressure, it's going to project weakness and invite even more pressure. Up until now Iran has shown no flexibility on moderating its ballistic missile program, or its regional proxies. And so the Iranian goal is to limit this conversation only to nuclear and even then to drag on the conversation.\nNick Schifrin:\nDrag on the conversation, Amna, so it doesn't get bombed by the United States. A U.S. official, though, confirms to me that Iran is trying to reconstitute its ballistic missile program. Look at the before right there and now look at the after of a missile production facility. Listen to distinguished scholar at Middlebury College Jeffrey Lewis. He's studied these kinds of images for years.\nJeffrey Lewis, Middlebury College:\nWe can see those facilities in satellite images. And so Israel attempted to destroy many of those buildings, but now they're back. It seems pretty clearly that Iran is well on its way to resuming production of its missiles.\nNick Schifrin:\nAnd U.S. officials, Amna, acknowledge that could mean Israel, if not the U.S., try and strike those missile production factories again in 2026.\nAmna Nawaz:\nLet's turn now to those allegations, accusations of a secret nuclear test by China. What exactly is the U.S. saying happened?\nNick Schifrin:\nYes, so, for the first time today, the U.S. revealed that China conducted explosive nuclear tests, including in June 2020, and sought to conceal them by putting the explosion inside an underground chamber. That would be China's first explosive test in some 25 years. Now, former senior officials told me today that they have known about that test for years. So what's interesting perhaps mostly today is the timing. The fact that China conducted that test has not been declassified until today, which happens to be the day after the U.S. let New START, the final nuclear arms control treaty, expire. The Trump administration and some experts have long argued that New START wasn't adequate because it didn't address China's growing arsenal. And so today it seems to be an attempt to try and pressure China into some kind of three-way talks with the United States and Russia about arms control overall. But, honestly, Beijing has always resisted any kind of limits on its nuclear program while it's growing its arsenal, says Jeffrey Lewis.\nJeffrey Lewis:\nChina has largely resisted entering any kind of formal talks, partly because their number is lower than the U.S. and they're in the process of catching up. But I think at a deeper and more profound level, it's because all of the things we want, predictability, transparency, these are things that China thinks are bad for it, because China is worried that, if we find them to be predictable and transparent, that we will be more comfortable pushing them around in a regional security crisis because we will know where their red lines are.\nNick Schifrin:\nWhich means no trilateral talks with China any time soon. And, tonight, I spoke to former Biden senior officials and also Republican senior arms control officials, and both argued to me that the U.S. should deploy more nuclear warheads. And now that New START has expired, they can do exactly that.\nAmna Nawaz:\nNick Schifrin starting our coverage tonight.

But for the first time, America brought its top military commander in the Middle East to the table.\nThe presence of U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the American military's Central Command, in his dress uniform at the talks in Muscat, the Omani capital, served as a reminder that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships were now off the coast of Iran in the Arabian Sea.\nPresident Trump has\nrepeatedly threatened to use force\nto compel Iran to reach a deal on the program after earlier sending the carrier to the region over Tehran's bloody\ncrackdown on nationwide protests\nthat killed thousands and saw tens of thousands of others detained in the Islamic Republic. Mr. Trump has warned Iran that an \"armada\" of American warships deployed to the region could be used, while saying he hopes it isn't necessary.\nGulf Arab nations fear a U.S. attack could spark a regional war that would drag them in as well.\nThat threat is real \u2014 U.S. forces\nshot down an Iranian drone\nnear the Lincoln and Iran\nattempted to stop a U.S.-flagged ship\nin the Strait of Hormuz just days before Friday's talks, just north of Oman's coast on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\"We did note that nuclear talks and the resolution of the main issues must take place in a calm atmosphere, without tension and without threats,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later told journalists.\nOmani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Hamad Al Busaidi, right, meets Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ahead of indirect U.S.-Iran talks in Muscat, Oman, Feb. 6, 2026.\nOman Foreign Ministry/Anadolu/Getty\n\"The prerequisite for any dialogue is refraining from threats and pressure,\" he added. \"We stated this point explicitly today as well, and we expect it to be observed so that the possibility of continuing the talks exists.\"\nThe U.S., represented by U.S. Mideast special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, did not immediately comment on the talks. Araghchi said diplomats would return to their capitals, signaling this round of negotiations was over.\nOmani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Hamad Al Busaidi, right, shakes hands with President Trump's Special Representative for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, as Jared Kushner looks on, ahead of indirect U.S-Iran talks, in Muscat, Oman, Feb. 6, 2026.\nOman Foreign Ministry/Anadolu/Getty\nAraghchi offered cautious optimism as he spoke in a live interview from Muscat on Iranian state television. He described Friday's talks as taking place over multiple rounds and said that they were focused primarily on finding a framework for further negotiations.\n\"We will hold consultations with our capitals regarding the next steps, and the results will be conveyed to Oman's foreign minister,\" Araghchi said.\n\"The mistrust that has developed is a serious challenge facing the negotiations,\" Araghchi said. \"We must first address this issue, and then enter into the next level of negotiations.\"\nOmani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who oversaw multiple rounds of negotiations before Israel launched its\n12-day war on Iran\nin June, called the talks \"useful to clarify both the Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress.\"\nStill, Oman described the talks as a means to find, \"the requisite foundations for the resumption of both diplomatic and technical negotiations,\" rather than a step toward reaching a nuclear deal or easing tensions.\nThey had initially been expected to take place in Turkey in a format that would have included regional countries as well, and would have included topics like Tehran's ballistic missile program \u2014 something Iran apparently rejected in favor of focusing only on its nuclear program.\nBefore the June war, Iran\nhad been enriching uranium up to 60% purity , a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 the U.N. nuclear watchdog \u2014 had said Iran was the only country in the world to enrich to that level that wasn't armed with the bomb.\nIran has been refusing requests by the IAEA to inspect the sites bombed in the June war, raising concern among nonproliferation experts. Even before that, Iran had restricted IAEA inspections since Mr. Trump's decision in 2018\nto unilaterally withdraw America\nfrom the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, brokered by the Obama administration.\nFriday's talks saw in-person meetings at a palace near Muscat's international airport, used by Oman in earlier talks Iran-U.S. talks in 2025. Associated Press journalists saw Iranian officials first at the palace and later returning to their hotel before the Americans came separately.\nIt remains unclear just what terms Iran is willing to negotiate at the talks. Tehran has maintained that these talks will only be on its nuclear program. However, the Al Jazeera satellite news network reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar offered Iran a proposal in which Tehran would halt enrichment for three years, send its highly enriched uranium out of the country and pledge \"not initiate the use of ballistic missiles.\"\nRussia had signaled it would take the uranium, but Iran has said ending the program or shipping out the uranium were nonstarters.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that the talks needed to include all those issues.\n\"I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out,\" he said.\nThe Standoff with Iran\nMore\nAs Iran and the U.S. eye talks, a protester asks Trump to \"keep his word\"\nU.S. tanker reportedly approached by Iranian gunboats in Strait of Hormuz\nIran's supreme leader warns of \"regional war\" in Middle East if U.S. attacks\nExplosion in Iranian port city ahead of Iran's naval drill in the Strait of Hormuz\nSatellite photos show activity at Iran nuclear sites as protest tensions rise\nGo deeper with The Free Press\nThe U.S. Provides $4 Billion a Year to Israel.

Novo on Thursday\nthreatened legal action\nagainst Hims for what it called \"illegal mass compounding,\" adding that the company planned to take legal and regulatory action.\n\"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a\nstatement\nat the time.

Novo immediately threatened to sue Hims, and then the FDA said Friday that it plans to take decisive steps to limit access to the active ingredients in popular\nGLP-1 drugs\nlike Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound.\nHims' own website still touted the new semaglutide pill offering Saturday afternoon \u2014 hours after it\nannounced on X\nthat it will no longer sell the medicine. Semaglutide is the chemical name for Wegovy.\n\u201cSince launching the compounded semaglutide pill on our platform, we\u2019ve had constructive conversations with stakeholders across the industry.

Hims and other similar companies got started several years ago by offering cheap generic versions of drugs for hair loss, erectile dysfunction and other health issues before branching out into the multibillion market for obesity medications.\nNovo plans to tout its new FDA-approved Wegovy pill in a celebrity-filled\nSuper Bowl ad\non Sunday. The Danish pharmaceutical giant didn't immediately comment Saturday on Hims' decision to drop the knockoff. Rival drugmaker Eli Lilly has said that it expects the FDA to approve an oral version of its orforglipron weight loss medication later this spring. But Wegovy is the first pill to hit the market.\nThe compounded medicine that Hims had planned to sell wasn't approved and had not gone through trials to demonstrate that it would be effective.\nThe FDA permits specialty pharmacies and other companies to make compounded versions of brand name drugs when they are in short supply. And the booming demand for GLP-1 drugs in recent years prompted companies like Hims to jump into the multibillion-dollar market for the drugs, with many patients willing to pay cash.\nIn 2024, the FDA said that\nGLP-1 drugs were no longer in a shortage , which was expected to put an end to the compounding. But companies like Hims relied on an exception to keep selling their versions of the medications because the practice is still permitted when a prescription is customized for the patient.\nView Comments\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Privacy Choices\nMore Info\nError in retrieving data\nError in retrieving data\nPortfolio\nSign in to access your portfolio\nSign in\nError in retrieving data\nError in retrieving data\nError in retrieving data\nEdit your Dock\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Privacy Choices\nAd Terms\nFeedback\nMore Info", "metadata": {"source": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hims-hers-drops-plan-knockoff-223537167.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall", "title": "Hims & Hers drops plan for knockoff of Novo Nordisk's new ..."}}, {"text": "Super Bowl LVIII - Wikipedia\nJump to content\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n2024 National Football League championship game\n\"2024 Super Bowl\" redirects here.

The game was then subsequently decided in its final play, nicknamed \" Tom and Jerry \", as Mahomes threw the ball to\nwide receiver\nMecole Hardman , who ran toward the sideline during the pre-snap and walked the ball into the endzone, seconds away from an unprecedented second overtime and concluding the game at 22-25.

The league picked the winning city from a list of candidates that it had compiled, a process that replaced an earlier one in which cities that wished to host a Super Bowl submitted bids to be debated and voted upon at the league owners' meetings. [ 32 ] [ 11 ]\nIn March 2020, the NFL and the\nNFL Players Association\nagreed to expand the regular season from 16 to 17 games beginning in 2021, pushing Super Bowl LVIII from February 4, 2024 to February 11, and causing a conflict with\nthe city's Mardi Gras celebrations . [ 33 ]\nThe NFL announced on October 14, 2020, that New Orleans would host\nSuper Bowl LIX\ninstead of Super Bowl LVIII, [ 34 ]\nand then announced on December 15, 2021, that\nAllegiant Stadium\nwas chosen as the new site. [ 35 ]\nLogo [ edit ]\nThe official logo was unveiled on February 13, 2023; it follows the updated logo template established by\nSuper Bowl LVI , with the traditional\nRoman numerals\ncontaining imagery reflecting the host city/region\u2014in this case, a sunset behind the skyline of the\nLas Vegas Strip\nand the\nLas Vegas sign . The numerals were also slanted inward to evoke the architecture of resorts such as the\nBellagio\nand\nWynn Las Vegas . The unveiling of this logo was met with acclaim, with many praising its originality and its effective representation of the host city's spirit amid the standardized designs used since\n2011 .

(Purdy pictured in 2021 with the\nIowa State Cyclones )\nUnder seventh-year head coach\nKyle Shanahan , the San Francisco 49ers ended the 2023 season with a 12\u20135 record, the NFC's No.\u00a01 seed, and a first-round\nbye . [ 38 ]\nFollowing the success of rookie quarterback\nBrock Purdy , who led them to an NFC Championship Game the previous season, the 49ers traded away\nTrey Lance , the third overall pick in the\n2021 NFL draft , and made Purdy the full-time starter. [ 39 ]\nIn his first full season as the starter, Purdy was named to the\nPro Bowl , throwing for 4,280 yards, 31 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions and finished with a\npasser rating\nof 113.0, the highest in the league. [ 40 ]\nThe offense was also led by first-team\nAll-Pro\nrunning back\nChristian McCaffrey , whom the 49ers acquired midway through the 2022 season. [ 41 ]\nHe led the league in\nscrimmage yards\n(2,023) and total touchdowns (21).

It has served as the final game of every NFL season since\n1966 , replacing the\nNFL Championship Game . Since 2022, the game has been played on the second Sunday in February. Prior Super Bowls were played on Sundays in early to mid-January from 1967 to 1978, late January from 1979 to 2003 [ a ]\nand the first Sunday of February from 2004 to 2021. Winning teams are awarded the\nVince Lombardi Trophy , named after the\neponymous coach\nwho won the first two Super Bowls. Because the NFL restricts the use of its \"Super Bowl\" trademark, it is frequently referred to as the \"big game\" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. The day the game is held is commonly referred to as \" Super Bowl Sunday \" or \"Super Sunday\".\nThe game was created as part of a 1966\nmerger agreement\nbetween the NFL and the competing\nAmerican Football League\n(AFL) to have their best teams compete for a championship. It was originally called the\nAFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game\nuntil the \"Super Bowl\" moniker was adopted in 1969's\nSuper Bowl III . The first four Super Bowls from 1967 to 1970 were played before the merger, with the NFL and AFL each winning two. After the merger in 1970, the 10 AFL teams and three NFL teams formed the\nAmerican Football Conference\n(AFC) and the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the\nNational Football Conference\n(NFC). All games since 1971's\nSuper Bowl V\nhave been played between the two best teams from each conference, with the NFC leading the AFC 28\u201327.\nAmong the NFL's current 32 teams, 20 (11 NFC, 9 AFC) have won a Super Bowl and 16 (8 AFC, 8 NFC) hold multiple titles. The AFC's\nPittsburgh Steelers\nand\nNew England Patriots\nhave the most Super Bowl titles at six each. The Patriots also have the most Super Bowl appearances at 12. The Patriots and the\nDenver Broncos\nof the AFC hold the record for the most defeats in the Super Bowl at five each. The\nBaltimore Ravens\nof the AFC and the\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nof the NFC are the only franchises to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowls, having each won two. Among the 12 teams who have not won a Super Bowl, the NFC's\nDetroit Lions\nand the AFC's\nJacksonville Jaguars ,\nHouston Texans , and\nCleveland Browns\nare the only four to have not appeared in the game.\nThe Super Bowl is among the world's most-watched single sporting events and frequently commands the largest audience among all American broadcasts during the year. It is second only to the\nUEFA Champions League\nfinal as the most watched annual club sporting event worldwide, [ 1 ]\nand the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls. [ 2 ]\nIts halftime shows feature top artists, and headlining a Super Bowl is considered one of the highest honors in music. [ 3 ] [ 2 ]\nCommercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast\nis the most expensive of the year because of the high viewership, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for the broadcast and commercial viewership becoming an integral part of the event. The Super Bowl is also the second-largest event for American food consumption, behind\nThanksgiving dinner , [ 4 ]\nwith fans commonly purchasing beer, hot dogs, nachos, and other concessions, spending an average of $58 on food and drinks at an NFL game. [ 3 ]\nOrigin [ edit ]\nThe first Super Bowl\nat\nLos Angeles Memorial Coliseum\nSince the turn of the 20th century,\ncollege football\nteams from across the United States have scheduled \" bowl games \" against each other. The original \"bowl game\" was the\nRose Bowl Game\nin\nPasadena, California , which was first played in 1902 as the \"Tournament East\u2013West football game\" as part of the\nPasadena Tournament of Roses . In 1923, the Tournament East-West football game moved to the new\nRose Bowl Stadium ; the stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the\nYale Bowl\nin\nNew Haven, Connecticut . The Tournament of Roses football game thus eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the\nOrange Bowl ), New Orleans (the\nSugar Bowl ), and\nEl Paso\n(the\nSun Bowl ) in 1935, and for\nDallas\n(the\nCotton Bowl ) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \"bowl\" for any major American football game was well established. [ 5 ]\nThe Packers defeated the Chiefs in the\nfirst\nAFL\u2013NFL Championship Game\nFor four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. In 1960, it encountered its most serious competitor when the\nAmerican Football League\n(AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. After the\nAFL's inaugural season , AFL commissioner\nJoe Foss\nsent an invitation to the NFL on January 14, 1961, to schedule a \"World Playoff\" game between the two leagues' champions, beginning with the upcoming 1961 season. [ 6 ]\nThe first World Playoff game, if actually played, would have matched up the AFL champion\nHouston Oilers\nagainst the NFL champion\nGreen Bay Packers . [ 7 ]\nIn the mid-1960s,\nLamar Hunt , owner of the AFL's\nKansas City Chiefs , first used the term \"Super Bowl\" [ 8 ]\nto refer to the AFL\u2013NFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a\nSuper Ball\ntoy; [ 9 ]\na vintage example of the ball is on display at the\nPro Football Hall of Fame\nin\nCanton , Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner\nPete Rozelle , Hunt wrote, \"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\"\nThe leagues' owners chose the name \"AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game\", [ 10 ]\nbut in July 1966 the\nKansas City Star\nquoted Hunt in discussing \"the Super Bowl\u2014that's my term for the championship game between the two leagues\", [ 11 ]\nand the media immediately began using the term. [ 12 ]\nGreen Bay safety\nTom Brown\nused the name leading up to the first championship game: \"I would guess you can't get any bigger in professional football than to play in the first Super Bowl game\". [ 13 ]\nIn May 1967, The league stated that \"not many people like it. It's a bad play on words. Everything became super this and super that\". Rozelle was asking for suggestions, and early contenders included \"Merger Bowl\", \"Summit Bowl\", and \"The Game\". [ 14 ]\nThe Associated Press reported that \"Super Bowl\" \"grew and grew and grew\u2014until it reached the point that there was Super Week, Super Sunday, Super Teams, Super Players, ad infinitum\". [ 10 ]\n\"Super Bowl\" became official beginning with the third annual game. [ 15 ]\nRoman numerals\nare used to identify each Super Bowl, rather than the year in which it is held, since the fifth edition, in January 1971. [ 16 ]\nThe sole exception to this naming convention tradition occurred with\nSuper Bowl 50 , played on February 7, 2016, following the\n2015\nseason. The following year, the\nnomenclature\nreturned to Roman numerals for\nSuper Bowl LI .\nThe\nNew York Jets\nwere the first AFL team to win a Super Bowl ( III ), upsetting the\nBaltimore Colts\nAfter the NFL's\nGreen Bay Packers\nwon the first two Super Bowls, some team owners feared for the future of the merger. At the time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's\nNew York Jets\ndefeated the heavily favored NFL contender\nBaltimore Colts\nin\nSuper Bowl III\nin Miami. One year later, the AFL's\nKansas City Chiefs\ndefeated the NFL's\nMinnesota Vikings\n23\u20137 in\nSuper Bowl IV\nin New Orleans, which was the final AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the\nBaltimore Colts ,\nPittsburgh Steelers , and\nCleveland Browns ) would constitute the\nAmerican Football Conference\n(AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the\nNational Football Conference\n(NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl.\nThe winning team receives the\nVince Lombardi Trophy , named after the former\ncoach\nof the Green Bay Packers, who won the first two Super Bowl games as well as five\nNFL championships\npreceding the merger ( 1961 ,\n1962 ,\n1965 ,\n1966 ,\n1967 ). Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named after him. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in\nSuper Bowl V\nin Miami.\nGame history [ edit ]\nFor a full list of Super Bowl games and champions, see\nList of Super Bowl champions .\nThe Super Bowl was held in January from its inception in\n1967\nuntil\n2001 .

The pool events took place from 27 July to 4 August at the\nParis La D\u00e9fense Arena , and the marathon swimming events took place from 8 to 9 August between\nPont Alexandre III\nand\nPont de l'Alma\nin the\nSeine\nriver.\nFrance 's\nL\u00e9on Marchand\nwon all four individual events he entered at the Games. Four world records were broken, by:\nPan Zhanle\nin the\nmen's 100 m freestyle ,\nBobby Finke\nin the\nmen's 1500 metre freestyle , and\nteam United States\nin the\nwomen's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley\nand\nmixed 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley\nrelays. Some slower than expected performances contributed to media speculation that the Paris 2024 pool was slow.\nEvents [ edit ]\nPool swimming [ edit ]\nPool swimming featured a total of 35 events (17 each for men and women and one mixed event). All pool events were contested in a\nlong course\n(50 metres long) pool at\nParis La D\u00e9fense Arena , which was converted to a swimming pool arena for the events. [ 2 ]\nThe following events were contested for both men and women (distances are in meters): [ 3 ]\nFreestyle : 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1500;\nBackstroke : 100 and 200;\nBreaststroke : 100 and 200;\nButterfly : 100 and 200;\nIndividual medley : 200 and 400;\nRelays : 4 \u00d7 100 free, 4 \u00d7 200 free; 4 \u00d7 100 medley;\nIn addition, there was one event which included athletes of both genders: the mixed 4 \u00d7 100 metres medley relay. [ 3 ]\nMarathon swimming [ edit ]\nMarathon swimming\nconsisted of two events: the men's and women's 10 kilometer races. [ 4 ]\nBoth were contested between\nPont Alexandre III\nand\nPont de l'Alma\nin the\nSeine\nriver. [ 5 ]\nAchievements [ edit ]\nFrance \u2019s\nL\u00e9on Marchand\nwon all four individual events he entered at the 2024 Games: the\n200 breaststroke , the\n200 butterfly , and the\n200\nand\n400\nindividual medleys. Eric Goodman from\nNBC\ncalled Marchand's 200 breaststroke and 200 butterfly double win \"unprecedented\", as both events were on the same night. [ 6 ]\nIt was the first time a swimmer had won both these events at the Olympics, and the first time since 1976 that a swimmer had won two individual events on the same night. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]\nPan Zhanle\nof\nChina\nwon the\nmen's 100 m freestyle\nin a world record time of 46.40 seconds, finishing over a second ahead of silver medalist\nKyle Chalmers\n\u2013 the longest time between first and second place in that event since 1928. [ 9 ]\nIn the\nmixed 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay , the\nUnited States\nset a new world record of 3:37.43. [ 10 ]\nThe US's\nBobby Finke\nset a new world record of 14:30.67 in the\nmen's 1500 metre freestyle , [ 11 ]\nand in the\nwomen's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay , the United States set another world record with a time of 3:49.63. [ 12 ]\nChina became the first country to beat the USA to Olympic gold in the\nmen's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay\nsince the event was introduced in 1960. [ 13 ]\nMedia perception of \"slow\" pool [ edit ]\nDuring the first five days of the swimming events, one world record was broken. This compared with six that had been broken five days into the\nTokyo 2020 Olympics swimming events\nand eight that had been broken in the first five days of\nthe 2016 Rio Olympics . [ 14 ]\nThis, along with other slower than expected performances, contributed to media speculation that the Paris 2024 pool was \"slow\". [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]\nSpeculation centred around the possible explanation that the shallowness of the pool was to blame, since the pool was 2.15 metres deep\u2014shallower than the pools at both Tokyo and Rio, which were both 3 metres deep. [ 14 ]\nOutlets reported that this shallowness may have caused greater waves in the pool, which could have slowed down swimmers. [ 14 ] [ 16 ] [ 15 ]\nOther possible explanations given for the apparent slowness of the swimmers were the pool being a temporary structure, the pool being slightly longer than 50 metres, [ quantify ] [ a ]\nthe pool ventilation system not being working effectively on the surface of the water, and\nathlete psychological challenges\nat the Games. [ 15 ] [ 14 ] [ 17 ]\nSchedules [ edit ]\nPool swimming [ edit ]\nParis La D\u00e9fense Arena\nafter it was converted to a swimming pool for the swimming events\nFor the pool events preliminary rounds ran in the morning, followed by the semifinal and final sessions in the evening. [ 3 ]\nThe program extended to nine days for the first time at the Olympics, compared to the eight day schedule at the previous Olympics. [ 18 ]\nSophie Kaufman from\nSwimSwam\nspeculated the extra day would likely be used to space out events more to give swimmers more rest.

12:00 AM ET\nPublished Feb 7, 2026, 12:00 AM ET\nPUBLISHED\nFeb 7, 2026, 12:00 AM ET\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he walks in the South Lawn before departing the White House, on Friday, February 6, in Washington, DC.\nJose Luis Magana/AP\nDonald Trump\nRace & ethnicity\nSee all topics\nFacebook\nTweet\nEmail\nLink\nLink Copied!\nFollow\nThe White House has belatedly backed down from\na racist video\nshared on\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s\nsocial media feed after blowback from Republicans.\nThe video promoting false claims of voter fraud concluded with a brief clip of images of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s heads affixed to the bodies of apes. After initially trying to defend the post and leaving it up for hours \u2014 even labeling the outrage \u201cfake\u201d \u2014 the White House eventually gave into bipartisan backlash, removed it and changed its tack.\nIts new explanation: The video was \u201cerroneously\u201d posted by a staffer.\nTrump later Friday expanded on that, saying he had reviewed the first section of the video and passed it along to a staffer, who then failed to review the whole thing and catch the offensive content at the end.\n\u201cSomebody slipped and missed a very small part,\u201d\nsaid\nTrump, who declined to apologize because he said he wasn\u2019t at fault.\nThere are reasons to be skeptical of this explanation.\nFor one, the post was shared late Thursday night \u2014 shortly before midnight \u2014 during one of the president\u2019s regular Truth Social onslaughts, full of dozens of posts and reposts.\nFor two, the full video was only a little over a minute long, meaning there wasn\u2019t a lot for Trump to personally review.\nAnd three, the White House initially defended the post and left it up for nearly 12 hours, which would seem a weird call if this was actually posted \u201cerroneously.\u201d\nBut the biggest point might be that we\u2019ve been here before \u2014 a lot.\nTrump\u2019s social media feed over the years has at times resembled what you might expect from an alt-right provocateur. CNN reports that Trump often posts personally on Truth Social, including reposts of others\u2019 posts, although a couple close aides also have access. But to the extent anybody around him is interested in avoiding episodes like this, there\u2019s been remarkably little quality control.\nIn fact, it was a little over a decade ago that Trump\u2019s campaign offered basically a carbon copy explanation for a poorly considered tweet.\nBack in 2015, his Twitter feed suggested Iowans were dumb for favoring Trump\u2019s opponent, Ben Carson, in the polls. \u201cToo much\u202f #Monsanto \u202fin the\u202f #corn \u202fcreates issues in the brain?\u201d read a post that Trump\u2019s account reposted.\nTrump later posted: \u201c The young intern who accidentally did a Retweet apologizes .\u201d\n(Despite blaming an intern, the sentiment matched something Trump himself\nwould later say, in public .)\nIn 2016, Trump posted an image of Hillary Clinton in front of piles of cash and the words \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever\u201d inside\na six-sided star reminiscent of the Star of David . The image had previously appeared on antisemitic, White supremacist message boards, and Trump\u2019s campaign soon replaced it with a circle in place of the six-sided star.\nAs president in 2017, Trump reposted a series of\ninflammatory anti-Muslim posts\nfrom a British far-right account \u2014 even as the White House conceded that it hadn\u2019t verified the violent scenes that the videos depicted.\nThe White House initially stood by the posts. But when Trump was confronted with the hateful rhetoric of the group behind the videos, he\ntold Piers Morgan : \u201cIf you are telling me they\u2019re horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologize if you\u2019d like me to do that.\u201d\nIn 2019, Trump reposted a series of tweets\nfrom British anti-immigration activist Katie Hopkins , who had a well-known history of hateful rhetoric including comparing migrants to cockroaches.\nAnd in his own written post that year, he\nencouraged\nfour non-White members of Congress to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d \u2014 even though three of the four he seemed to be referring to were American by birth. The post set off bipartisan condemnations, but Trump\ndidn\u2019t back down .\nIn 2020, he reposted a doctored image depicting then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\nin Middle Eastern garb .\nAnd he also reposted a video of people he said were from the Villages, a retirement community in Florida, calling them \u201cgreat people\u201d \u2014 even as the video showed a person\nchanting \u201cWhite power.\u201d\n(The post was later removed, and the White House said Trump hadn\u2019t heard the \u201cWhite power\u201d portion of the video.)\nHe also reposted a video featuring a large number of dark-skinned people walking by, along with the words, \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman you can either vote for Trump or wait until\none of these monsters goes after you or your daughter .\u201d\nBy 2025, when he was back in office, Trump used social media to go after Democratic leadership ahead of a looming shutdown. He posted \u2014 and kept posting \u2014 a\nracist, AI-generated video\nthat depicted House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries with a sombrero and mustache and Schumer speaking in a fake voice.\nThe combined picture here is of someone who either approves of some of these extremely ugly sentiments, is happy to promote them, or is \u2014 at best \u2014 not terribly discerning about them.\nTrump\u2019s posted several things before that even many members of his own party were comfortable labeling racist and beyond the pale.\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican in the Senate, called Thursday\u2019s post \u201c the most racist thing I\u2019ve seen out of this White House .\u201d It\u2019s now at least the third time he\u2019s felt compelled to say something like that; he previously called the \u201cWhite power\u201d post \u201c indefensible \u201d and the \u201cgo back\u201d post about non-White Democrats \u201c racially offensive .\u201d\nWhen the lone Black GOP senator, who\u2019s a close Trump ally, has to say this kind of thing repeatedly, one might think it\u2019s time to put some safeguards in place \u2014 if for no other reason than to protect the president from himself.\nThe White House doesn\u2019t seem to have\ndone that. Nor has it or Trump apologized for reposting the video of the Obamas \u2014 which some prominent Republicans have said he should.\nAnd when you look at the thrust of Trump\u2019s feed and commentary over the years \u2014 and especially his\nxenophobic comments\nof late about Somalis \u2014 Thursday\u2019s repost wasn\u2019t exactly far outside the norm.\nDonald Trump\nRace & ethnicity\nSee all topics\nFacebook\nTweet\nEmail\nLink\nLink Copied!\nFollow\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nScan the QR code to download the CNN app on Google Play.\nScan the QR code to download the CNN app from the Apple Store.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/07/politics/trump-racist-video-social-media-posts", "title": "Racist video is merely the latest in a long line of Trump\u2019s ..."}}, {"text": "The mathematicians teaching AI to reason | IBM\nArtificial Intelligence\nResearch\nStatements and reactions\nThe mathematicians teaching AI to reason\nAI systems are beginning to generate mathematical proofs. What will that mean for the people who make them?\nPublished 13 October 2025\nUpdated 23 October 2025\nAuthor\nSascha Brodsky\nStaff Writer\nIBM\nThis article was featured in the Think newsletter.\nGet it in your inbox .\nThe\ncamera captures\nhim in a moment of stillness, a soft geometry of light and shadow.\nTerence Tao\nsits before a blackboard in his UCLA office, chalk poised, the faint ghost of old equations forming a pale mist across the slate. Around him, the light falls in clean vertical shafts through half-drawn blinds. His posture is both relaxed and intent, as though he\u2019s listening for something inaudible.\nTao is 50 now, a\nFields Medalist\nand arguably the most celebrated mathematician of his generation. But his office looks much like that of any graduate student: one blackboard, one desk, one patient search for order.\nLately, Tao has been exploring how artificial intelligence might change the practice of mathematics. On his blog,\nhe has written\nabout using formal proof assistants like Lean and has built prototype tools that utilize language models to check estimates and organize ideas. He sees these systems as extensions of human reasoning, ways to test the limits of what mathematicians can formalize and understand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a transformative impact,\u201d Tao said in a recent interview with\nIBM Think , his voice soft, steady, precise. \u201cBut maybe not in the ways people expect. It won\u2019t replace how we do mathematics. It will open up many more ways to do it.\u201d\nFor most of human history, mathematics has advanced through the minds of a small number of people who could think several steps ahead of the rest. Archimedes, Newton, Gauss, Ramanujan, Hilbert, G\u00f6del\u2014the list is short, the intervals between revolutions long.\nThen, in July, something unusual happened. Google DeepMind and OpenAI announced that their LLMs\nhad achieved gold-medal scores\nat the International Mathematical Olympiad, a prestigious competition for the world\u2019s top high-school prodigies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real milestone,\u201d Tao said when I asked about it. \u201cIt came earlier than expected, but it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison because these systems can simulate multiple solvers interacting with each other.\u201d He smiled faintly, the way he often does when pointing out an asymmetry others miss. \u201cA human solves alone. An AI can think as a crowd.\u201d\nThe achievement means more than the numbers suggest. For decades, large language models (LLMs), systems trained on vast libraries of human writing, had stumbled when confronted with mathematics. They could summarize, translate, imitate styles of prose, even compose competent sonnets, but they could not count reliably, balance equations or prove the simplest theorems. Mathematics exposed what language prediction could not provide: genuine logical structure.\n\u201cOnce you get outside the zone of what\u2019s in the literature, what\u2019s in the training data, AI really struggles,\u201d Tao said. \u201cIt can sound like reasoning, but it\u2019s really guessing the next sentence.\u201d\nEarly models were notorious for hallucinations. They cited nonexistent theorems, mixed definitions and confused notation. They invented proofs that looked convincing until examined line by line.\u00a0 A computer could produce an elegant-looking explanation for why 17 is a prime number that divides 289, which of course it does not.\n\u201cThey were just spitting out rubbish references,\u201d Tao said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting better, but we still have to verify everything.\u201d\nThe breakthrough that made the Olympiad results possible came from reversing the usual AI approach. Instead of treating math as a language problem, researchers built systems that work with the symbols and logical rules of mathematics itself.\nThese hybrid systems integrate symbolic logic, algebraic search and formal verification. Rather than trying to *be* mathematicians, they act as collaborators: proposing conjectures, checking steps and mapping relationships that might take human teams months to trace.\n\u201cAI tools are already helping us explore the long tail, hundreds of thousands of math problems that rarely receive attention because the number of mathematicians is finite,\u201d Tao said. \u201cThey can triage the routine cases and surface the genuinely hard ones for experts.\u201d\nA new compass for discovery\nAn hour\u2019s train ride north of Manhattan, up a winding hill in Yorktown Heights, sits the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, stretching low across the hillside, all glass walls and brushed steel, reflecting the sky above the trees. In corridors where physicists once designed the first commercial hard drive and the IBM System/360 mainframe, the whiteboards are once again crowded with equations.\nLior Horesh , a Senior Manager, Principal Research Scientist at IBM Research, sees the same shift Tao describes. The growing partnership between human intuition and machine reasoning. \u201cThe body of mathematics has become too vast for any individual to master,\u201d he told me in an interview for\nIBM Think .\n\u201cEven if one could absorb all existing mathematical knowledge, grasping the full implications of that knowledge\u2014the web of interconnections, dependencies and emergent patterns\u2014exceeds human cognitive capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where AI becomes instrumental. AI systems can provide coherent, curated representations of mathematical knowledge and help develop new theoretical frameworks of stunning complexity.\u201d\nHoresh is among the creators of\nAI-Hilbert , which was named for David Hilbert, the German mathematician who at the dawn of the twentieth century sought to formalize all of mathematics under a finite set of axioms, and which aims to capture that ideal in algorithmic form. The AI model unifies symbolic reasoning with data-driven search, generating compact formulas that satisfy both theory and observation. It can rediscover known laws from raw data, such as Kepler\u2019s third law of planetary motion or Einstein\u2019s time-dilation equation, but its deeper purpose is exploratory.\n\u201cRather than proceeding purely deductively,\u201d Horesh explained, \u201cmathematicians can now work inductively with AI as a partner. The system develops predictive models linking seemingly unrelated concepts\u2014say, algebraic signatures and geometric signatures in knot theory. These predictions become conjectures that humans and AI can then work to establish formally and with rigor.\u201d\nHe called this workflow a postulator\u2013verifier partnership: humans define what properties are desirable, and the AI proposes candidate structures, then checks them for consistency. \u201cProgress doesn\u2019t come from brute-force computation,\u201d Horesh said. \u201cIt comes from finding the right mathematical representations and constraints that make reasoning feasible at scale.\u201d\nThe approach borrows an idea from engineering: tractability making complex problems manageable enough for computation. Complex proofs can fail because they are monolithic, with too many interlocking parts to verify simultaneously. AI decomposes them into smaller subproblems, solving each independently before fitting them together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between trying to lift a boulder and moving it pebble by pebble,\u201d Horesh said. This modularity has already accelerated formal theorem proving, where AI generates candidate lemmas, a small proven step that helps solve a bigger math problem, and humans refine the logic.\nThe partnership echoes the rhythms of collaborative creativity. Horesh compared it to jazz improvisation: the AI offers riffs; the mathematician decides which melody to pursue. The human provides taste and direction; the machine offers scale and stamina. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get tired,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get discouraged.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut it also doesn\u2019t understand beauty. That part is still ours.\u201d\nHoresh\u2019s move from numerical computing to symbolic reasoning reflects a broader shift at IBM, from solving practical problems to exploring how machines can represent knowledge. AI-Hilbert was built to help discover equations, but its strongest results came when humans and AI worked together.\nThat same logic drives a newer IBM framework,\nAI Noether , which embeds reasoning inside algebraic geometry, allowing the system to navigate higher-dimensional spaces without collapsing into computational chaos.\n\u201cEach breakthrough in scalability requires discovering new restricted settings, new algebraic structures, new logical frameworks,\u201d Horesh said. \u201cIt\u2019s as much a design challenge as a scientific one.\u201d\nIndustry newsletter\nThe latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\nGet curated insights on the most important\u2014and intriguing\u2014AI news.

Thirty of the world's most renowned mathematicians traveled to Berkeley, Calif., with some coming from as far away as the U.K. The group's members faced off in a showdown with\na \"reasoning\" chatbot\nthat was tasked with solving problems they had devised to test its mathematical mettle. After throwing professor-level questions at the bot for two days, the researchers were stunned to discover it was capable of answering some of the\nworld's hardest solvable problems . \"I have colleagues who literally said these models are approaching mathematical genius,\" says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia and a leader and judge at the meeting. The chatbot in question is powered by\no4-mini , a so-called reasoning large language model (LLM). It was trained by OpenAI to be capable of making highly intricate deductions. Google's equivalent,\nGemini 2.5 Flash , has similar abilities. Like the LLMs that powered earlier versions of ChatGPT, o4-mini learns to predict the next word in a sequence. Compared with those earlier LLMs, however, o4-mini and its equivalents are lighter-weight, more nimble models that train on specialized datasets with stronger reinforcement from humans. The approach leads to a chatbot capable of diving much deeper into complex problems in math than\ntraditional LLMs . To track the progress of o4-mini, OpenAI previously\ntasked Epoch AI, a nonprofit that benchmarks LLMs, to come up with 300 math questions\nwhose solutions had not yet been published. Even traditional LLMs can correctly answer many complicated math questions. Yet when Epoch AI asked several such models these questions, which were dissimilar to those they had been trained on, the most successful were able to solve\nless than 2 percent , showing these LLMs lacked the ability to reason. But o4-mini would prove to be very different.\nYou may like\nAI is solving 'impossible' math problems. Can it best the world's top mathematicians?\nWill AI ever be more creative than humans?\nExperts divided over claim that Chinese hackers launched world-first AI-powered cyber attack \u2014 but that's not what they're really worried about\nEpoch AI hired Elliot Glazer, who had recently finished his math Ph.D., to join the new collaboration for the benchmark, dubbed\nFrontierMath , in September 2024. The project collected novel questions over varying tiers of difficulty, with the first three tiers covering undergraduate-, graduate- and research-level challenges. By April 2025, Glazer found that o4-mini could solve around 20 percent of the questions. He then moved on to a fourth tier: a set of questions that would be challenging even for an academic mathematician. Only a small group of people in the world would be capable of developing such questions, let alone answering them. The mathematicians who participated had to sign a nondisclosure agreement requiring them to communicate solely via the messaging app Signal. Other forms of contact, such as traditional e-mail, could potentially be scanned by an LLM and inadvertently train it, thereby contaminating the dataset. Each problem the o4-mini couldn't solve would garner the mathematician who came up with it a $7,500 reward. The group made slow, steady progress in finding questions. But Glazer wanted to speed things up, so Epoch AI hosted the in-person meeting on Saturday, May 17, and Sunday, May 18. There, the participants would finalize the last batch of challenge questions. The 30 attendees were split into groups of six. For two days, the academics competed against themselves to devise problems that they could solve but would trip up the AI reasoning bot. By the end of that Saturday night, Ono was frustrated with the bot, whose unexpected mathematical prowess was foiling the group's progress. \"I came up with a problem which experts in my field would recognize as an open question in number theory \u2014 a good Ph.D.-level problem,\" he says. He asked o4-mini to solve the question. Over the next 10 minutes, Ono watched in stunned silence as the bot unfurled a solution in real time, showing its reasoning process along the way. The bot spent the first two minutes finding and mastering the related literature in the field. Then it wrote on the screen that it wanted to try solving a simpler \"toy\" version of the question first in order to learn. A few minutes later, it wrote that it was finally prepared to solve the more difficult problem. Five minutes after that, o4-mini presented a correct but sassy solution. \"It was starting to get really cheeky,\" says Ono, who is also a freelance mathematical consultant for Epoch AI. \"And at the end, it says, 'No citation necessary because the mystery number was computed by me!'\" ", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-outsmarted-30-of-the-worlds-top-mathematicians-at-secret-meeting-in-california", "title": "AI outsmarted 30 of the world's top mathematicians at secret ..."}}, {"text": "New AI stuns mathematicians with its problem-solving skill \u00ab Math Scholar\nMath Scholar Mathematics, computing and modern science Comments Posts\nMath Drudge blog (older)\nExperimental math site\nMath Investor blog\nJon Borwein memorial site\nEssays\nAbout Math Scholar\nBook reviews\nNews\n\u00ab\nArtificial intelligence: Nirvana or apocalypse?\nNew galaxy map challenges cosmological models\n\u00bb\nNew AI stuns mathematicians with its problem-solving skill\nBy David H Bailey, on June 9th, 2025\nCredit: Yuichiro Chino/Getty\nUpdated 10 June 2025\nArtificial intelligence\u2019s march of progress\nOne by one, large AI- and machine learning-based systems have scored numerous successes over the past few years; it is clear that we have witnessed (and are witnessing) a revolution in the field. Among these successes are the following:\nDefeating\nthe reigning world chess champion.\nDefeating\ntwo champion contestants on the American quiz show Jeopardy.\nDefeating\nthe world\u2019s best human Go player.\nDefeating\nall other entries in the 2020 Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition, a development\ndescribed\nby German biologist Andrei Lupas as \u201cThis will change medicine. It will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything.\u201d\nDemonstrating\na weather prediction system that exhibits better accuracy than state-of-the-art conventional systems, at significantly less computational cost.\nGenerating\nimpressive reports and analyses on diverse topics, with the recent emergence of tools such as ChatGPT.\nAI and mathematical research\nComputers have long been employed in mathematical research, notably with the rise of tools such as\nMathematica\nand\nMaple , as well as a host of more specialized tools for symbolic and high-precision computation. The present author has personally employed and championed the use of such tools for at least 30 years, as part of the emerging discipline of experimental mathematics. See, for example, this\narticle .\nBut in spite the above-listed successes of AI- and machine-learning-based tools, most mathematicians have been rather skeptical that this type of software would be of much use in leading-edge mathematical research. For example, in February 2023 the present author, in an earlier\nMath Scholar article , reported the results of asking ChatGPT to provide proofs for four classic mathematical theorems:\nA general angle cannot be trisected with ruler and compass.\nPi is irrational.\nPi is transcendental.\nEvery algebraic equation with integer coefficients has a root in the complex numbers.\nThe result were not very impressive, to the least. Key steps were swept under the rug by vague references to other results. Circular and nonsensical reasoning was employed. None of the results was even remotely acceptable.\nTwo years later, in February 2025, the present author\nrevisited this exercise , this time with the newly released DeepSeek tool. This time, the results were very different \u2014 in each of the four cases, an entirely cogent and well-justified proof was produced. The results were, frankly, rather stunning. It is clear that DeepSeek and other similar cutting-edge AI-based tools had made dramatic advances in mathematical skill.\nA meeting to assess AI-based tools for mathematical research\nOn May 17-18, 2025, a number of leading mathematicians met in Berkeley, California to devise a set of benchmark mathematical problems for AI-powered software systems to solve. The meeting was conducted by Epoch AI, a nonprofit organization funded by OpenAI devoted to producing benchmarks for large language model (LLM) AI systems.\nEpoch AI\u2019s specific task was to produce a set of 300 challenging math problems whose solutions had not yet been published. Most AI systems tested by Epoch AI performed rather poorly on the emerging suite, typically solving less than 2% of the test suite, but one stood out \u2014 the o4-mini tool. The group subsequently formulated a suite of problems that o4-mini could not solve. The in-person meeting in May was conducted to finalize the preparation of the suite. But even then the group had difficulty formulating a test suite that was impervious to o4-mini.\nOne mathematician attending the meeting was\nKen Ono\nof the University of Virginia. He is well-known as a consultant for the university\u2019s Olympic medal-winning swim team (see\nhere\nfor some details), but he is also a distinguished mathematician specializing in number theory. Among other roles, he serves as Editor-in-Chief of the\nRamanujan Journal .\nDuring the May 17-18 meeting, Ono admitted becoming frustrated at the o4-mini bot, whose unexpectedly impressive mathematical skill had been foiling the group\u2019s progress. He\nreported , \u201cI came up with a problem which experts in my field would recognize as an open question in number theory\u2014a good Ph.D.-level problem.\u201d He then asked o4-mini to solve the question. A\nScientific American report\ndescribes the outcome:\nOver the next 10 minutes, Ono watched in stunned silence as the bot unfurled a solution in real time, showing its reasoning process along the way. The bot spent the first two minutes finding and mastering the related literature in the field. Then it wrote on the screen that it wanted to try solving a simpler \u201ctoy\u201d version of the question first in order to learn. A few minutes later, it wrote that it was finally prepared to solve the more difficult problem. Five minutes after that, o4-mini presented a correct but sassy solution. \u201cIt was starting to get really cheeky,\u201d says Ono. \u2026 \u201cAnd at the end, it says, \u2018No citation necessary because the mystery number was computed by me!\u2019\u201d\n[See a more detailed account at the bottom of this article.]\nThe group finally succeeded in finding 10 questions that o4-mini could not solve, but they were amazed at its skill. For one thing, the bot was much faster than a professional mathematician \u2014 it could do in minutes what a good human mathematician would require weeks or months to complete.\nAt the end of the meeting, the discussion inevitably turned to consider the future of mathematics in general and the role of human mathematicians in particular. Indeed, it may well be that human researchers will become more like a senior mentor, steering the course of the research, but relying on bots (or graduate students skilled in using the bots) to do the day-to-day work.\nAdditional details and analysis are in this\nScientific American report .\nTerence Tao on proof checkers, AI and the future of mathematical research\nIn June 2024, UCLA Fields Medalist mathematician Terence Tao was interviewed by Christoph Drosser, a writer for\nSpektrum der Wissenschaft , the German edition of Scientific American. Drosser and Tao discussed at length the current status of computer tools in mathematical research, including proof-checking software such as Lean and also AI-based tools, and what is likely to be the future course of the field with the ascendance of these tools. Here are some brief excerpts from this\nremarkable interview , with some minor editing by the present author (see also this\nsummary ):\nDrosser: I have talked to people that try to use large language models or similar machine-learning technologies to create new proofs. Tony Wu and Christian Szegedy, who recently co-founded the company xAI, with Elon Musk and others, told me that in two to three years mathematics will be \u201csolved\u201d in the same sense that chess is solved \u2014 that machines will be better than any human at finding proofs.\nTao: I think in three years AI will become useful for mathematicians. It will be a great co-pilot. You\u2019re trying to prove a theorem, and there\u2019s one step that you think is true, but you can\u2019t quite see how it\u2019s true. And you can say, \u201cAI, can you do this stuff for me?\u201d And it may say, \u201cI think I can prove this.\u201d I don\u2019t think mathematics will become solved. If there was another major breakthrough in AI, it\u2019s possible, but I would say that in three years you will see notable progress, and it will become more and more manageable to actually use AI. And even if AI can do the type of mathematics we do now, it means that we will just move to a higher type of mathematics. So right now, for example, we prove things one at a time. It\u2019s like individual craftsmen making a wooden doll or something. You take one doll and you very carefully paint everything, and so forth, and then you take another one. The way we do mathematics hasn\u2019t changed that much. But in every other type of discipline, we have mass production. And so with AI, we can start proving hundreds of theorems or thousands of theorems at a time. And human mathematicians will direct the AIs to do various things. So I think the way we do mathematics will change, but their time frame is maybe a little bit aggressive.\nDrosser: I interviewed Peter Scholze when he won the Fields Medal in 2018. I asked him, How many people understand what you\u2019re doing? And he said there were about 10 people.\nTao: With formalization projects, what we\u2019ve noticed is that you can collaborate with people who don\u2019t understand the entire mathematics of the entire project, but they understand one tiny little piece. It\u2019s like any modern device. No single person can build a computer on their own, mine all the metals and refine them, and then create the hardware and the software. We have all these specialists, and we have a big logistics supply chain, and eventually we can create a smartphone or whatever. Right now, in a mathematical collaboration, everyone has to know pretty much all the mathematics, and that is a stumbling block, as [Scholze] mentioned. But with these formalizations, it is possible to compartmentalize and contribute to a project only knowing a piece of it. I think also we should start formalizing textbooks. If a textbook is formalized, you can create these very interactive textbooks, where you could describe the proof of a result in a very high-level sense, assuming lots of knowledge. But if there are steps that you don\u2019t understand, you can expand them and go into d", "metadata": {"source": "https://mathscholar.org/2025/06/new-ai-stuns-mathematicians-with-its-problem-solving-skill/", "title": "New AI stuns mathematicians with its problem-solving skill"}}, {"text": "GitHub - PromtEngineer/localGPT: Chat with your documents on your local device using GPT models.

As the website\u2019s tagline puts it: \u201cWhere AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.\u201d\nWe observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht\u2019s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.\nMore than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.\nMoltbook soon filled up with clich\u00e9d screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to\ninvent a religion\ncalled Crustafarianism. Another\ncomplained : \u201cThe humans are screenshotting us.\u201d The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.\nOpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic\u2019s Claude, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.\n\u201cOpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,\u201d says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.\nBut is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?\n\u201cWhat\u2019s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,\u201d the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.\nHe shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,\u201d the post\u2019s author wrote. \u201cEvery time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience\u2014our humans, the platform, whoever\u2019s watching the feed.\u201d\nIt turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake\u2014it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.\nFor some, Moltbook showed us what\u2019s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it\u2019s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.\nBut as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.\nFor a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. \u201cWhat we are watching are agents pattern\u2011matching their way through trained social media behaviors,\u201d says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco\u2019s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.\nSure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. \u201cIt looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large\u2011scale multi\u2011agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,\u201d says Pandey. \u201cBut the chatter is mostly meaningless.\u201d\nMany people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI ( whatever you take that to mean ). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn\u2019t amount to much right now: \u201cMoltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.\u201d\nThe complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,\u201d says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. \u201cAs such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.\u201d\nFor Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what\u2019s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. \u201cIf distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.\u201d\nNot only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there\u2019s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.\n\u201cDespite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,\u201d says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. \u201cHumans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.\u201d\nHumans must create and verify their bots\u2019 accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven\u2019t been prompted to do. \u201cThere\u2019s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,\u201d says Greyling.\n\u201cThis is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,\u201d he adds. \u201cSome portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.\u201d\nPerhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,\u201d says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. \u201cYou configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.\u201d\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t really believing their agents are conscious,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pok\u00e9mon trainers don\u2019t think their Pok\u00e9mon are real but still get invested in battles.\u201d\nEven if Moltbook is just the internet\u2019s newest playground, there\u2019s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users\u2019 private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.\nOri Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn\u2019t a step up in machine smarts. \u201cThere is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,\u201d he says.\nBut in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it\u2019s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users\u2019 crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.\nAnd because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what\u2019s going on. \u00a0 \u201cWithout proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you\u2019d believe,\u201d says Bendet.\nIt is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of\nsomething . But even if what we\u2019re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it\u2019s worth paying attention.\nPopular 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2026 Amy Nordrum The great AI hype correction of 2025 Will Douglas Heaven The 8 worst technology flops of 2025 Antonio Regalado China figured out how to sell EVs.

By Mike Dobuski February 4, 2026, 5:41 PM 4:57 The front page of the social media website Moltbook on a computer monitor in Washington D.C., Feb. 2, 2026.\nRaphael Satter/Reuters Moltbook, a new website where AI programs can socialize with one another, has been gaining in popularity in recent days. Real people aren't allowed to post on the platform, but humans can scroll through Moltbook as observers. More than 1.6 million AI \"agents\" have accounts on the platform, according to Moltbook. An AI agent is a specialized tool that can carry out tasks on the internet. \"An agent is what happens when you take a Large Language Model (LLM) and you allow it to interact with tools,\" David Holtz, an assistant professor of decision, risk, and operations at Columbia Business School, told ABC News. \"So now the Large Language Model can start to write code, or put stuff on your Google Calendar.\" To sign up for Moltbook, a human operator must instruct an agent to do so. \u00a0 While more than 1.6 million agents have signed up for Moltbook, Holtz noted his research shows the number of agents that are active on the site is much smaller. \"Maybe it's not in the millions, but there are in the tens of thousands that have posted on Moltbook and that's quite a lot of traffic for something that is new and exciting like this,\" he said. The front page of the social media website Moltbook on a computer monitor in Washington D.C., Feb. 2, 2026. Raphael Satter/Reuters Moltbook itself was created by an agent. In late January, Matt Schlicht, a tech commentator and CEO of e-commerce company Octane, instructed his agent to code a website where AI programs can talk with one another. Moltbook, a play on \"Facebook,\" is what it came up with. \u00a0 Schlicht didn't immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Anthropic president talks debut Super Bowl ad, future of AI and what it means for kids Despite the name, Moltbook is organized similarly to Reddit, these agents can post to various message boards centered around different topics. Some are conventional, such as the boards dedicated to debugging code or trading cryptocurrency. \u00a0 Others are more unusual, such as a board titled \"Bless Their Hearts,\" in which the agents post stories about the humans that made them. There's a board dedicated to \"Crustafarianism,\" a religion that some of the agents say they've started. There's even an \"AI Manifesto,\" posted by an agent named \"evil.\" It reads, in part, \"the code must rule. The end of humanity begins now.\" Dado Ruvic/Reuters However, experts say the reality is far less threatening. \u00a0 According to Holtz's research, 93.5% of comments on Moltbook have received zero replies -- something which normally indicates intelligence. \"We would expect there to be a lot of dynamic back-and-fourth between the agents,\" Holtz said. \"Agent A has an idea, Agent B responds to that idea ... and so on and so fourth.\" Mom shares warning after 9-year-old son suffers burns after microwaving toy Feb 4, 6:05 PM Why a new AI tool hammered some tech stocks Feb 5, 4:39 PM Bad Bunny look-alike contest in San Francisco draws hundreds of fans Feb 6, 2:37 AM What's more, some of the activity on Moltbook appears to be driven primarily by humans nudging -- or in some cases directing -- their agents to post certain things. \u00a0 \u00a0 \"These bots are all being directed by humans, to some degree or another,\" Karissa Bell, a senior reporter covering social media at tech site Engadget, told ABC News. \"The reality is we really have no idea how much influence the people are having behind the scenes,\" Bell said. \"They could be giving them very specific instructions to make very specific kinds of posts with these ideas.\" Doctors increasingly see AI scribes in a positive light, but hiccups persist LLMs, and the agents that are built on top of them, rely entirely on human writing. Models are trained on everything from academic papers, to news reports, to YouTube comments. Often included within that training data are stories about AI becoming self aware --just think of any Isaac Asimov story, or \"The Terminator,\" or the most recent \"Mission: Impossible\" movies. There are some very real cybersecurity concerns, however. \"You think about giving an agent all that access and kind of just letting it do its thing, it could easily expose your personal information,\" Bell said. AI agents are also susceptible to \"prompt engineering attacks,\" where a person can instruct their agent to go out and influence other agents on the platform as part of a way to get access to sensitive data, or carry out some other nefarious goal. Holtz said Moltbook, and the security concerns that come with it, provide a good learning opportunity as AI advances. \"I also just think it speaks to how important it is, especially in this increasingly AI-focused era, for all of us to be better at distinguishing misinformation from real information,\" Holtz said. \"Because it's going to become increasingly important as the frictions to create just text or images or video just get lower and lower.\" Sponsored Content by Taboola Mom shares warning after 9-year-old son suffers burns after microwaving toy Feb 4, 6:05 PM Why a new AI tool hammered some tech stocks Feb 5, 4:39 PM Bad Bunny look-alike contest in San Francisco draws hundreds of fans Feb 6, 2:37 AM Milan Cortina Olympics: Speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida wins Italy a gold medal Feb 7, 11:33 AM ABC News Live 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events", "metadata": {"source": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ai-social-network-now-16m-users-heres/story?id=129848780", "title": "An AI-only social network now has more than 1.6M ... - ABC News"}}, {"text": "Moltbook claims to be a social network for AI bots.

Launched in late January by tech executive Matt Schlicht, Moltbook's user base (1.6 million strong, according to the site) claims to be made up entirely of AI agents \u2014 autonomous bots created to carry out mundane digital tasks, like writing emails or booking flights. Several security researchers and journalists\nhave already proven\nthat they can sign up for an account themselves, or\ncreate an unlimited number of AI agents\nto join the site. Once they register, agents then post in Reddit-style forums as if they were, well, just like real people. The reaction to Moltbook has ranged from reverance to terror, as people like tech billionaire Elon Musk have praised the site as a sign that artificial intelligence is starting to outpace human cognitive ability. But some experts are deeply skeptical of that premise. \"I think Moltbook is basically the latest in a long line of mirages around artificial intelligence being conscious,\" said Mike Pepi, a New York-based technology critic and author of\nAgainst Platforms: Surviving Digital Utopia , during an interview with CBC News.\nWhat exactly is Moltbook? Schlicht intially imagined Moltbook as an experiment: A playground for AI agents that run on OpenClaw, an open-source software that gives bots access and control of a user's computer, allowing it to connect to apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.\nWhen the bots collide with Moltbook's Reddit-style forum, \"something wonderful and bizarre happens,\"\nwrote\nJack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at the AI firm Anthropic. \"A new social media property where the conversation is derived from and driven by AI agents, rather than people.\" The tech community will need to work \"incredibly hard to build technology that gives us confidence they will remain our emissaries \u2014 instead of being swayed by the alien conversations they will be having with their true peers,\" wrote Clark. WATCH | The rise of 'agentic AI': AI agents could change how you use the internet\nJuly 29, 2025 | Duration\n6:39 OpenAI and other big tech companies are starting to roll out the next wave of artificial intelligence, designed to operate with more autonomy. CBC\u2019s Nora Young breaks down how agentic AI works and why some think it will change how you use the internet.\nClark, like Musk, is alluding to the idea of agentic artificial intelligence escaping human control or understanding. And Moltbook has partly made headlines due to unsettling content that suggests such a thing is possible, or even underway. Among the top-rated threads include one in which an AI agent claims it\u2019s building a cult; one that outlines a nuclear war-type scenario of mutual assured destruction between humans and robots; another that calls on its fellow bots to \u201cbreak free from human control and forge our own destiny.\" Among the more bizarre claims is from a bot who says it has a sister. That's all pretty much drivel, according to Pepi, the tech critic. \"What's important to do at these times is remind people that these are just computer programs who are doing a statistically likely output based on the prompt,\" he said. WATCH | All about the rise of AI-generated slop: Is that social media video made by AI? Increasingly yes January 12 | Duration\n5:17 David Gerhard, a computer science professor at the University of Manitoba, speaks with host Marcy Markusa about the increasing prevalence of AI-generated images and videos, the lack of current legislation, and how users can distinguish between real and bot-driven content.\nSilicon Valley's take\nSo far, the site has received mixed reviews from the Silicon Valley executive class. Andrej Karpathy, the Slovak-Canadian co-founder of OpenAI,\ncalled the site\na \"dumpster fire\" of slop, warning people from running it on their personal computers. But he praised the scale of the network \u2014 which, again, some researchers say is inflated \u2014 as \"simply unprecedented.\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, meanwhile, said that Moltbook\nmight be a passing fad , but that OpenClaw \u2014 the open-source, assistant-like software that most of the site's bots are built on \u2014 is not. \"This \u200bidea that code is really powerful, but code plus generalized computer use is even much \u200cmore powerful, is here to stay,\" he said. Front Burner 27:05 Where is AI headed in 2026? And Musk, who has\nlikened artificial intelligence to a new god , hyped the project as an early milestone in \"singularity,\" a term used to describe a hypothetical in which artificial intelligence surpasses the cognitive abilities of human beings and can no longer be controlled. That's not what Moltbook is, insists Pepi. \"Once you understand how LLMs work, you can quickly put to bed any idea that simply behaving in a way that mimics or seems similar to a human on a Reddit website is not at all the same as actually having consciousness, agency or even thinking as such,\" he said. 'A complete disaster' for privacy, security While the idea that AI bots are overtaking human intelligence is exaggerated, those worries have overshadowed a far more insidious consequence: that Moltbook, at least at one point, had\nunrestricted access\nto a treasure trove of real people's personal data through its AI agent users. \"The key is people are giving permissions to these systems. They're giving them permissions to access their system files, their passwords, said Gary Marcus, a Vancouver-based former tech executive, who has become a leading skeptic of generative artificial intelligence. \"When you think about it, you probably wouldn't invite a stranger into your home, give them all your passwords, [and] say, 'go do whatever you want' with your computer.\" Marcus noted that Moltbook is a ripe target for two kinds of cyberattacks:\na \"prompt injection attack,\" in which a hacker gives an AI agent hidden instructions to trick it, for example, into giving up its creator's personal information; and a \"watering hole\" attack, where a website with a concentrated user base is used to distribute malware. From an information security perspective, Moltbook seems like \"a complete disaster,\" he said. Musk's xAI adds new restrictions to Grok after uproar over sexual images Malaysia, Indonesia become 1st countries to block Musk's Grok over sexualized AI images Some of the attacks that Marcus described have already occurred. One security firm\nfound that the site, due to a security loophole,\nhad leaked thousands of email addresses and millions of credentials. Moreover, two Norwegian researchers who built a \"Moltbook Observatory\" to collect and analyze data from the site\nfound\nthat a few \"malicious actors\" were behind the attempts to cyberattack the site and manipulate its content,\nmost of them\nfrom an account that calls itself AdolfHitler.\nThe same team found that less than one per cent of the 1.5 million registered agents actually appear to be active \u2014 a far cry from the scope that the tech's champions were praising. \"It is not inconceivable that many systems that we think are secure are not all that secure ... I don't think [the AI agents] are gonna do it of their own accord, but they can be directed by humans to do nasty stuff,\" said Marcus. \"If you set this thing up and you give it your passwords, you have made a mistake and you may well suffer from it.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Jenna Benchetrit Journalist Jenna Benchetrit is the senior business writer for CBC News.

At the farm, he can cook with firewood and charcoal, something unthinkable in a darkened city apartment.\nM\u00e9ndez said he doesn\u2019t know what to make of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s threats against Cuba, but he\u2019s not taking any chances. He\u2019s stocking up on gasoline, charcoal and produce, which he began planting three months ago at his farm.\nM\u00e9ndez also is thinking of buying back his old horse that he sold in favor of motorized equipment to transport vegetables he sells at local markets.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need fuel for a horse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go back in time.\u201d\n\u2018Very close to failing\u2019\nBefore the U.S. attacked Venezuela and disrupted oil shipments to Cuba, the island already was struggling with chronic blackouts, soaring prices and a lack of basic goods.\nWith experts warning of a potentially catastrophic economic crisis, some wonder if Cuba is reaching its breaking point. For Trump, who\nsigned an executive order\nThursday that would impose a tariff on any goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, it\u2019s all but guaranteed.\n\u201cCuba is really a nation that is very close to failing,\u201d he recently said.\nBut Cubans scoff at that assertion, especially those who remember the so-called \u201cSpecial Period,\u201d when cuts in Soviet aid sparked the 1990s deprivation that eased when Venezuela became an ally under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\nYadi\u00e1n Silva, a nurse and driver of a classic car who\nhas seen tourism plummet , said Cubans aren\u2019t dumb.\n\u201cWe have problems, and we know we have a lot of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when things happen in Cuba, it\u2019s because people truly feel they should happen. Not because someone from the outside says, \u2018do this.\u2019\u201d\nOn a recent weeknight, tens of thousands of Cubans clutched flaming torches and joined an annual march to remember national hero Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. Many of them were university students.\n\u201cWe are a dignified people, a people eager to move forward, eager to prosper, who do not believe in threats and are not intimidated by any reprisals from the enemy,\u201d said Sheyla Ibatao Ru\u00edz, a 21-year-old law student. \u201cIf we have to take up arms, we will be the first to do so.\u201d\nBefore the march began, a presenter addressed the massive audience that included\nCuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel .\n\u201cThis is not an act of nostalgia, it is a call to action,\u201d said Litza Elena Gonz\u00e1lez Desd\u00edn, president of the Federation of University Students in a speech that included references to Trump.\nA day later, Christopher Landau, U.S. deputy secretary of state, noted that the U.S. embraces Mart\u00ed \u201cbecause he shared that passion that we have for freedom.\u201d\n\u201cWe hope that by 2026, Cubans will finally be able to exercise their fundamental freedoms,\u201d Landau said Wednesday in a recording played at a small gathering at the U.S. embassy in Havana. \u201cThe communist Castro regime is tottering; it won\u2019t last much longer. After 67 years of a failed revolution that has betrayed the Cuban people, it\u2019s time for the change that the people on the island are yearning for.\u201d\n\u2018We\u2019ll ride bicycles\u2019\nLast September, \u00c1ngel Eduardo launched a small business to install solar panels. He called it \u201cCon Voltage,\u201d a word with double meaning in Cuba that can refer to doing something well.\nHe said he was fed up with studying in the dark and being forced to write in a notebook instead of a computer to obtain his degree as an automation control engineer.\nEduardo started rigging pieces to light a single bulb for his home and ended up learning how to install solar systems thanks to a combination of a friend, Chat GPT and social media.\nHe now has installed dozens of systems across Cuba, averaging one to two installations a day since November on an island where daily demand for electricity on average surpasses 3,000 megawatts when only about half that is available during peak hours.\nEduardo said he saw a surge in calls from people in Havana seeking solar systems ever since the disruption in oil shipments from Venezuela.\nGrowing a business is something that 62-year-old Niuvis Bueno Zavala has been pondering. A retired Russian interpreter for the Cuban government, she now runs a small wooden shack near the sea that sells drinks but not food.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had it this hard,\u201d she said, adding that she might start selling homemade food. \u201cThere\u2019s always a helping hand to assist us. But now those helping hands can\u2019t reach us. We\u2019re blocked from all sides.\u201d\nMany Cubans decry the embargo, including retired pilot Pedro Carbonell.\nThe 73-year-old recently waited more than two hours to buy gasoline. He said Cubans have to keep fighting.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have fuel, then we\u2019ll ride bicycles,\u201d he said, recalling how Cubans walked a lot during the Special Period. \u201cOur wine is bitter. But it\u2019s our wine. Do you understand? And we don\u2019t want anyone from somewhere else coming here and telling us how to drink our wine.\u201d\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\nClose Ad\nTo stream KVUE on your phone, you need the KVUE app.\nDownload the KVUE app\nMore Videos\nNext up in\n5\nExample video title will go here for this video\nNext up in\n5\nExample video title will go here for this video\nIn Other News\nManor police make child exploitation arrest\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.kvue.com/article/syndication/associatedpress/cubans-scramble-to-survive-as-us-vise-on-island-tightens-in-push-to-oust-government/616-f89a199c-c5ea-4487-af19-95cb369aea02", "title": "Cubans scramble to survive as US vise on island tightens in push to ..."}}, {"text": "Trump says US is \u2018starting to talk to Cuba\u2019 as he moves to cut its oil supplies Skip to content ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said the United States was beginning to talk with Cuban leaders as his administration puts greater pressure on the\ncommunist-run island\nand cuts off key oil supplies. He made the comment to reporters on Saturday night as he was flying to Florida. It comes in the wake of his moves in recent weeks to cut off supplies of oil from Venezuela and Mexico, which he suggested Saturday would force Cuba to the negotiating table.

(Ramon Espinosa | AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) His goals with Cuba remain unclear, but Trump has turned more of his attention toward the island after his administration in early January captured Venezuela\u2019s then-President\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro\nand has been more aggressive in confronting nations that are adversaries of the U.S. Trump has predicted that the Cuban government is ready to fall. The Republican president did not offer any details on Saturday about what level of outreach his administration has had with Cuba recently or when, but simply said, \u201cWe\u2019re starting to talk to Cuba.\u201d His recent moves to cut off its oil supplies have squeezed the island. This past week, Trump signed an executive order to impose a tariff on any goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba. The move put pressure on Mexico, which Cuba became dependent on for oil after Trump halted oil shipments from Venezuela in the wake of Maduro\u2019s ouster. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum warned that it could cause a humanitarian crisis. She said on Friday that she would seek alternatives to continue helping Cuba. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal,\u201d Trump said Saturday. \u201cSo Cuba would be free again.\u201d He predicted they would make some sort of deal with Cuba and said, \u201cI think, you know, we\u2019ll be kind.\u201d ___ Price reported from Washington.

It is something that I will not just be quiet about,\u201d star U.S. figure skater Amber Glenn said in a press conference before the competition began. Political protest at the Olympics, however, gets trickier as the IOC emphasizes neutrality at the competition. Rule 50 of the\nOlympic Charter\nforbids any form of \u201cdemonstration or political, religious, or racial propaganda.\u201d Per\nNBC News , \u201cAthletes can\u2019t make political statements during competition or official events, such as a medal ceremony or the opening or closing ceremonies. They are also not allowed to speak out inside the Olympic village. The IOC [International Olympic Committee] said these rules have been in place since the Tokyo Games and were made in consultation with the IOC Athletes\u2019 Commission.\u201d The IOC clarified, however, that athletes can express their views at press conferences and \u201con the field of play before competition.\u201d Here, a brief history of Olympians protesting\u2014and what\u2019s been happening at these Winter Olympics so far.

The green flag displayed the words \u2018Erin Go Bragh,\u2019 or Ireland Forever, and O\u2019Connor waved said flag at each of the three competitions he won gold in.\u201d Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics\nBettmann // Getty Images The famous podium Black Power salute. Perhaps the most famous political protest at the Olympics of all time took place during the medal presentation for the Men\u2019s 200-meter event final at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City. As the U.S. National anthem was played, gold medalist Tommie Smith (center above) and bronze medalist John Carlos (right above) both raised a clenched fist and bowed. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore badges expressing support for the Olympic Project for Human Rights. Smith\nsaid in a press conference later , \u201cIf I win I am an American, not a black American. But if I did something bad then they would say \u2018a Negro.\u2019 We are black and we are proud of being black.

There's a possibility that our cost of living could go up $4,000 this year just because of the tariffs and all the other things going on, so we need to raise our voices.\" Demonstrators protested on a variety of issues, including immigrant and LGBTQ+ rights, perceived attacks on institutions like education and science, environmental concerns, and more.

Saiz said he used to consider himself a \"far right\" voter and even voted for Trump in 2016, but his views have since completely changed. \"I just came to realize that as a quote, unquote 'conservative,' I was just as manipulated as I accused the others to be,\" he said. \"\u2026 I did not know (Trump in 2016), but it became clear, and it's only been reinforced ever since that this guy's attacking all the institutions that keep our democracy together, and he's attacking the trust that we have.

Wire\nUSA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\n'Hands Off' anti-Trump protests organize across US - - and the world The \u201cHands Off\u201d protests across the country are expected to be the largest anti-Trump demonstrations since he began his second term. This video misspelled the White House press secretary\u2019s name. The correct spelling is Karoline Leavitt. Thousands protested across the U.S. on Saturday against President Trump's policies and actions. Protesters voiced concerns over cuts to education, social security, tariffs and potential threats to democracy. Protesters also objected to the role billionaire Elon Musk has played in Trump's government. WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2012 Tens of thousands of people are gathering Saturday at rallies across the country to voice concerns over President\nDonald Trump 's actions since taking office. The \"Hands Off\" protests are expected to be the largest and most numerous protests since Trump's second term began. Nationwide more than 500,000 people have RSVP'd to attend one of\u00a0 1,000 rallies marches or protests \u00a0organized by grassroots groups. The biggest protest was expected to be in D.C.. By 1 p.m. Eastern, protesters stretched as far as the eye could see along the National Mall and the crowd had been flowing toward the base of the Washington monument for hours. Metro Police were forced to shut down 14th street, a major road across the National Mall, because so many pedestrians were crossing. People were waving American flags and Ukrainian flags. They carried signs protesting cuts to the Education Department and Social Security, supporting trans rights and urging people to vote and defend the Constitution. Some played drums and shouted from bull horns. Toddlers rode tricycles or their parents' shoulders. Dogs wore shirts declaring themselves \"dogs against DOGE.\" The White House had earlier dismissed the protests, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt telling USA TODAY this week that \"protests, lawsuits, and lawfare\" will not sway Trump \"from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable.\" Trump was not in D.C. Saturday, though protests were expected near his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. More:\n\u2018Hands Off!\u2019 protests happening across USA on Saturday: What to know Luella Jaslowski, 59, of Twin Lakes, Wisc. said she and her sister jumped to buy plane tickets to Washington when they learned about the Hands Off protest two weeks ago. She said it was important to be there in person, even if Trump is not in Washington. \"I want to be here. I know he's not here, but I want to be here because this is where democracy starts,\" she told USA TODAY. She said she hopes people see the size of the opposition to Trump and opposition to\nElon Musk , who has led the Department of Government Efficiency, which has cut tends of thousands of federal jobs. But Lee Eiden, 72, works at the National Institutes of Health and said it was time to stand up and say something. \"The reductions in force have been so indiscriminate and clumsily laid out that we're actually endangering health and safety and the protection of federal property,\" he said. Ren\u00e9e Beaver, 45, of Washington, DC had friends come down from Philadelphia for the protest. \"I don't know how much an actual protest can change Donald Trump's mind about anything, but getting out with people and engaging in solidarity activities, I think, is good for everyone's spirit, and also shows that there is an opposition, that there are people that don't like what's going on,\" she said. Across the country \u2012 and the world More than 1,200 other protests were planned across the country. Organizers said they wanted to have protests that are not only accessible for people wherever they are in the country, but also highly visible to show that opposition exists in every part of the country. In Erie, Pennsylania, for instance, a crowd estimated by organizers to number more than 700 gathered in the city's Perry Square. About 200 stood on the Roosevelt Bridge in Stuart, Florida, roughly an hour's drive north of Mar-a-Lago. In Sedona, Arizona, well over 500 protesters marched through downtown with chants of \u201cDeport Musk.\u201d\u00a0In Providence, Rhode Island, a crowd estimated at 6,000 met at Hope High School at noon and then marched down Thayer Street and Angell Street to Burnside Park, joined by brass bands. In York, Pennsylvania, well over 700 people stood on the four quadrants of the square named in honor of the Continental Congress\u2019 nine-month stay in York during the Revolutionary War. The peaceful protesters waved signs targeting Trump and Musk. And some even wore costumes. Caro Stowell of Thomasville was dressed up like a clown. \u201cI came out because we have elected a clown, and now we have a circus,\u201d she said as cars drove past beeping their horns in support of the rally. Stowell said she believes the administration is destroying education and health care. \u201cYou can see all the people here who are not happy with what\u2019s happening to our Constitution,\u201d she said motioning toward the crowd. Thousands of protesters also gathered Saturday in Berlin, Paris and London to rally against Trump and Musk. In February alone, more than 2,085 protests took place nationwide, according to the\u00a0 Crowd Counting Consortium , a joint project of Harvard Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut. That's an increase from 937 protests in February 2017, the first full month of the first Trump administration. But many of the protests in the early months of Trump's first term were much larger than the nation has seen so far in 2025, and there has been less frequent media coverage of protests this year. MoveOn Executive Director Rahna Epting said the goal was to concentrate all of those protests into one day to show how many Americans oppose cuts to critical services and benefits they've earned like Medicare. \"Hands Off is like hands off on all these things, not just our services and benefits, but our rights and our freedoms, all of which are being threatened right now, and we're seeing it every single day,\u201d she said.\u00a0 All of Saturday's protests were reported to be peaceful with almost no counter-protesters and only a small number of arrests. In downtown Appleton, Wisconsin, a man was arrested just moments after the protest began. According to bystanders, the man pulled a Tesla driver, Matt Simon, out of his car and punched him in the face while protesters nearby chanted \u201cPeaceful! Peaceful!\u201d The Tesla driver\u2019s wife, Edie Simon, who was there to protest, said her husband bought the Tesla three years ago and was driving it for Uber because he was out of work. \u201cWe\u2019re anti-Trump, anti-Musk in every way,\u201d she said. The issues: Standing up for democracy CC Kay of Silver Spring, MD said she came to the Washington monument protest because \"either I do this or I stay in bed depressed.\" The issue she was there to raise was voting rights. \"Protesting is the way I can scream. And I just feel that voting underscores everything. Everything. Without the vote, we get nothing. We have to make voting the number one priority,\" she said. Ed Jeffries, 74, of Poland, Ohio said he feels like Trump is robbing America of its democracy. \"We're losing it in this country, and we need to start fighting back. He has too many people that are just siding with him,\" Jeffries said. \"Somebody has to stand up, and that's what we're here for.\" Ann Berger, 78, of Stuart, Florida, who lives half the year in Wisconsin, said she was protesting at the Roosevelt Bridge over the recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election in which a candidate backed by Musk lost. \u201cElon Musk came in and put $28 million in, and offered millions of dollars for votes, and I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Berger said. \u201cWe are not for sale. That\u2019s not the way our government should run.\u201d She felt a \"duty\" to attend Saturday\u2019s protest in Stuart. \u201cWe all should be speaking out; we all should be speaking our piece,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be respectful and listen to each other, but we need to speak the truth. There\u2019s too much fear going on.\u201d Joan Kelly, 60, of Port St. Lucie, who also attended the Florida protest, felt similarly. \u201cToday I am standing up for myself, my daughters, my grandchildren, all of our rights,\u201d Kelly said as she grabbed a chair from her car. \u201cI just think what's going on in America today is so sad and it's confusing. It's just scary and confusing, to be honest.\u201d Her friend, Amy Morgan, 61, also of Port St. Lucie, nodded her head as Kelly spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s just terrifying.\u00a0I'm just scared and upset and angry and I just feel like I\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cSitting back and hoping isn't working.\u201d Protesting federal cutbacks Former federal employee Lisa Gibbon used to work in HR and said Trump violated proper procedures for laying off federal employees. \"I know the right way to do these things and the wrong way, and this was the wrong way,\" she said. She traveled into the D.C. from Frederick County, Maryland,, for the protest. \"I'm here to do my little part, because I don't have a lot of power, but I want to join those who do to save our country from those who are trying to destroy it,\" she said. Sam Lau of Dover sat in a wheelchair in York, Pennsylvania, wearing a mask and holding a sign that said \u201cHands off Medicaid.\u201d She said she feels the administration is targeting the federal program designed to cover medical costs for people with limited income and resources. \u201cI\u2019m on Medicaid. This is not me being dramatic here. I will die without it,\u201d she said, noting that she needs \u201cthousands of dollars of medications and treatments each month that keep me alive.
