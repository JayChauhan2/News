For the first time since last year\u2019s war with Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted indirect talks over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. And for the first time, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test, just one day after letting a key nuclear arms treaty with Russia expire. Nick Schifrin reports.\nRead the Full Transcript\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nGeoff Bennett:\nWelcome to the \"News Hour.\" Today, across two continents, the U.S. confronted two very different nuclear challenges. For the first time since last year's war in Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted diplomacy focused on that country's nuclear program.\nAmna Nawaz:\nAnd for the first time today, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test just one day after letting the final nuclear arms control treaty with Russia expire, Nick Schifrin been covering both stories and joins us now. So, Nick, let's start with the U.S. and Iran. What do we know about how those talks went today?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, the Trump administration has provided no readout at the moment, but in the lead-up to these talks, we heard from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the top negotiator, Steve Witkoff, that Iran must not make any nuclear fuel domestically, must restrict the range of its ballistic missiles, must end its support for proxy groups and account for highly enriched uranium that has been missing since last summer's strikes. Today, the U.S. held indirect talks. You see Witkoff there with the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, meeting Oman's foreign minister, who then met with Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who said the talks focused on nuclear weapons and were a -- quote -- \"good start.\"\nAbbas Araghchi, Iranian Foreign Minister:\nWe were able to exchange our viewpoints, to express our concerns and our interests for a possible deal between the two sides on our nuclear question.\nNick Schifrin:\nAraghchi said there would be a new round of talks. No confirmation of that from the U.S. side, which for the first time included the top U.S. military commander from the Middle East, a reminder, Amna, of President Trump's threats against Iran and that military buildup still in the region.\nAmna Nawaz:\nSo what do the experts tell you all of that means for the possibility of an actual deal?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, that's the question I put to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is very skeptical of any deal of Iran's nuclear program, missile program, or support for proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas. Karim Sadjadpour, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: The Iranian regime still seems so intent on defying the United States and they fear that if they give into pressure, it's going to project weakness and invite even more pressure. Up until now Iran has shown no flexibility on moderating its ballistic missile program, or its regional proxies. And so the Iranian goal is to limit this conversation only to nuclear and even then to drag on the conversation.\nNick Schifrin:\nDrag on the conversation, Amna, so it doesn't get bombed by the United States. A U.S. official, though, confirms to me that Iran is trying to reconstitute its ballistic missile program. Look at the before right there and now look at the after of a missile production facility. Listen to distinguished scholar at Middlebury College Jeffrey Lewis. He's studied these kinds of images for years.\nJeffrey Lewis, Middlebury College:\nWe can see those facilities in satellite images. And so Israel attempted to destroy many of those buildings, but now they're back. It seems pretty clearly that Iran is well on its way to resuming production of its missiles.\nNick Schifrin:\nAnd U.S. officials, Amna, acknowledge that could mean Israel, if not the U.S., try and strike those missile production factories again in 2026.\nAmna Nawaz:\nLet's turn now to those allegations, accusations of a secret nuclear test by China. What exactly is the U.S. saying happened?\nNick Schifrin:\nYes, so, for the first time today, the U.S. revealed that China conducted explosive nuclear tests, including in June 2020, and sought to conceal them by putting the explosion inside an underground chamber. That would be China's first explosive test in some 25 years. Now, former senior officials told me today that they have known about that test for years. So what's interesting perhaps mostly today is the timing. The fact that China conducted that test has not been declassified until today, which happens to be the day after the U.S. let New START, the final nuclear arms control treaty, expire. The Trump administration and some experts have long argued that New START wasn't adequate because it didn't address China's growing arsenal. And so today it seems to be an attempt to try and pressure China into some kind of three-way talks with the United States and Russia about arms control overall. But, honestly, Beijing has always resisted any kind of limits on its nuclear program while it's growing its arsenal, says Jeffrey Lewis.\nJeffrey Lewis:\nChina has largely resisted entering any kind of formal talks, partly because their number is lower than the U.S. and they're in the process of catching up. But I think at a deeper and more profound level, it's because all of the things we want, predictability, transparency, these are things that China thinks are bad for it, because China is worried that, if we find them to be predictable and transparent, that we will be more comfortable pushing them around in a regional security crisis because we will know where their red lines are.\nNick Schifrin:\nWhich means no trilateral talks with China any time soon. And, tonight, I spoke to former Biden senior officials and also Republican senior arms control officials, and both argued to me that the U.S. should deploy more nuclear warheads. And now that New START has expired, they can do exactly that.\nAmna Nawaz:\nNick Schifrin starting our coverage tonight.

He\u2019s toppled a Venezuelan dictator, sent federal agents on a deportation surge into Minnesota that killed two citizens \u2014 and is back\nmaligning the electoral system .\nAnd he is acquiring a taste for putting down a military hammer \u2014 he\u2019s struck sites in Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Venezuela and alleged drug boats in the Pacific and the Caribbean during his first year back in office.\nThat\u2019s one reason why his\nthreats to punish Iran\nfor cracking down on protesters and to prevent it ever reconstituting its nuclear program have teeth, as negotiations open Friday in Oman between officials from Washington and Tehran.\nBut with\napproval ratings\ndipping below 40%, in a midterm election year that already looks grim for Republicans, Trump must consider his ragged domestic standing alongside the hideously difficult military questions he\u2019s facing on Iran.\nTrump believes his volatility widens his negotiating room. Yet amid a new Iran crisis, it\u2019s getting harder to see how he emerges with the kind of crisp, easy win that he craves.\nThe president is convinced that Iran\u2019s clerical leaders want to do a \u201cdeal\u201d to avoid the possibility of war with the United States. He\u2019s amassed a significant naval force in the region and has military options to inflict a grievous blow.\nThis buildup has added steel to hard-driving diplomacy.\nAnd the Iranians may not be able to rely on a TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) moment. Trump\u2019s global belligerence has enforced red lines. He took bold action to assassinate Iranian military and intelligence chief Qasem Soleimani in Iraq in his first term. In his second, he sent US stealth bombers on a daring round-the-world trip to pulverize Iran\u2019s nuclear sites.\nTrump has also plunged into Iranian domestic politics more than any other 21st-century president, warning the clerical regime of reprisals for continued attacks on their own citizens, following a brutal crackdown last month that apparently killed thousands of people in cold blood.\nIn short, Trump has committed immense personal and geopolitical prestige to his latest test of wills with leaders in Tehran.\nWhy Iran is especially vulnerable\nIn this photo obtained by The Associated Press, Iranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran, Iran, on January 9, 2026.\nUGC/AP\nIt might just make sense for Trump to charge through a rare opening: Iran has never been weaker in its 45-year showdown with the United States:\n\u2022 The revolutionary regime\u2019s future is clouded by a succession crisis that is eroding its aura of permanence. The aged Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cannot go on forever.\n\u2022 Its crisis of political legitimacy has never been more extreme. Stark desperation and hopelessness drove protesters to the streets amid food and water shortages and grinding economic conditions.\n\u2022 And Iran\u2019s regional proxies \u2014 including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which once offered an insurance policy against outside attack \u2014 have been devastated by wars with Israel.\nThis trio of factors create a logical rationale for US military action against Iran. There may be no better time for Washington to topple a regime that has haunted its Middle East policy, threatened its allies, and killed many Americans, both in terror attacks and through militias during the Iraq war.\nThe opening may not last long. And if Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu don\u2019t take the shot now, they may regret a lost opportunity in years to come.\nIf Trump managed a feat beyond Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama and Biden by defeating one of America\u2019s most sworn enemies, he\u2019d earn a place in history that couldn\u2019t be denied. Given the current president\u2019s obsession with legacy, this must be a tantalizing prospect.\nIn an administration where the constraints on presidential action have all been removed, it may come down to Trump\u2019s instincts.\n\u201cThe most important deliberations are those which are happening inside President Trump\u2019s head,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson on Monday.\n\u201cI think if you look at his own precedent on three major occasions, he rolled the dice with Iran in 2018 \u2014 he left the nuclear deal. In 2020 he assassinated Iran\u2019s top military commander, Qasem Soleimani. And of course, last June, he bombed their nuclear sites, and he believes that all these decisions were vindicated, and now Iran is weaker than it has been in the past because it doesn\u2019t have any air defenses.\u201d\nSadjadpour went on: \u201cI think that context, coupled with the fact that Iran\u2019s leadership continues to taunt him and added to the fact that there isn\u2019t a grand bargain to be done, there is not a Nixon to China moment where you can get a great deal and normalize relations. And if he\u2019s already said he obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear program last June, it\u2019s unclear to me how getting another nuclear deal is going to be the outcome that he\u2019s looking for here.\u201d\nRisks of military action are higher than in Venezuela\nBut moving forward with military strikes would come with huge risks both in their execution and in the uncertain political conditions they may ensure.\nA serious attempt to either decapitate the Iranian regime or to devastate the military capacity of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Basij paramilitary militia would likely require a multi-day air campaign.\nAttempting to degrade Iran\u2019s capacity to crush new protests would run the high risk of civilian losses given that much of machinery of repression is sited in civilian areas. Without the unthinkable prospect of a major ground invasion, how effective could such an effort be when the recent crackdown was carried out with brutal close-quarters street violence?\nIran, the seat of the ancient Persian civilization, is more contiguous and less plagued by sectarian divides than Iraq \u2014 which splintered after the US invasion in 2003. But no one wants to test the impact of a power vacuum if the government falls, in the absence of any clear path to a return to democracy.\nAnd the short, sharp thunderclap strike of the type Trump prefers and that doesn\u2019t conflict with the no-foreign-quagmires mantra of his MAGA movement may not be sufficient to topple the clerical regime in Tehran.\nBut a longer military engagement with uncertain consequences would severely test Americans\u2019 trust in their president. A war that went wrong could devastate Republicans in November\u2019s already unpromising midterm elections.\nA sense of hubris has gathered around the White House since the toppling of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last month. But major US combat deaths in an Iranian war could effectively drain all the power and legitimacy from Trump\u2019s second term.\nThere\u2019ve also been signs in recent weeks that America\u2019s Gulf allies \u2014 with whom Trump is close \u2014 fear the consequences of a US attack on Iran. Short-term missile strikes by Iran are possible. Tehran could try to cripple regional oil infrastructure. And long-term unrest could jolt a region now transitioning towards lucrative new horizons like AI and tourism.\nSome of Iran\u2019s neighbors also fear chaos could ensue if Khamenei is killed because his country has known nothing but iron rule for more than 40 years. Another possibility is that the clerics could be succeeded by an equally brutal but more secular regime \u2014 that would seek to reconstitute its regional threat.\nIranian people wave national flags and hold up a portrait of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while fireworks illuminate the sky during a pro-government religious rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on February 4, 2026.\nMorteza Nikoubazl/NurPhotoGetty Images\nWhy diplomacy may not work either\nThis is all an argument for stepping back from the brink.\nBut after Trump\u2019s weeks of threatening rhetoric, a decision not to strike Iran could drain international credibility the president amassed with the strikes on the nuclear sites last year and with the stunning raid into Venezuela.\nAnd doesn\u2019t he also owe an obligation to Iran\u2019s people as they dream of freedom?\nTrump\u2019s predecessors avoiding encouraging a counter-revolution in Iran because they feared providing a pretext for even more fierce repression against demonstrators seen as US proxies. Trump had no such qualms and his vow that the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to punish Tehran for its crackdowns conceivably brought more people onto the streets.\nIf the president doesn\u2019t follow up, Iran\u2019s leaders may be even less reticent to inflict horrendous violence on their citizens come the next uprising.\nGiven the complexity of the military equation, it\u2019s obvious why the administration has not closed off a diplomatic exit ramp. But it\u2019s hard to see any deal that the president will offer Iran that it will be prepared to accept \u2014 and vice versa.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio laid out US goals ahead of the talks in Oman.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we\u2019re going to find out,\u201d Rubio said. He made clear that the administration wants to focus on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but ", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/politics/iran-us-negotiations-trump-analysis", "title": "Trump is beset by hard dilemmas and no easy wins with Iran"}}, {"text": "MSN", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/epstein-helped-fund-lavish-lifestyle-for-former-obama-wh-counsel/ar-AA1VmeUQ", "title": "Epstein helped fund lavish lifestyle for former Obama ... - MSN"}}, {"text": "As 'Sell America' market volatility rages on, look to your bonds Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Key Points U.S. investors aren't abandoning U.S assets, but more money has been flowing to international markets, and not just stocks but emerging markets credit, among other fixed-income strategies.\nConcentration in U.S. equities, rising volatility, a weak dollar, and recent hot performance for asset classes like emerging markets bonds, are all pushing portfolios to become broader in holdings across both stocks and bonds.

The U.S. dollar and Treasurys sold off on Tuesday, too.\nPresident Donald Trump's latest round of tariff threats, aimed at pressuring Europe to back a U.S. bid for Greenland, is stoking market instability.\nThe \"Sell America\" trade made a comeback on Tuesday following President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats against European allies, giving investors a taste of the volatility that rocked global markets back in April.\nAfter a short-lived attempt at a recovery in late-morning trading, U.S. stocks moved lower in the afternoon as Trump doubled down during a White House press conference. The selling wasn't confined to stocks: Treasury yields jumped, touching their highest levels since the summer, while the U.S. dollar sold off. Nor was it limited to the U.S., with stocks and bonds around the world selling off on Tuesday while haven assets like gold and the Swiss franc (USDCHF) rallied.\nThe S&P 500 finished Tuesday in the red for 2026, the first time that has happened this year.\n\"'Sell America' is back in a new form,\" Gina Martin Adams, chief market strategist at HB Wealth, said during an interview with MarketWatch. \"We came into this year with the market complacent on the idea that trade-policy risk was a 2025 story. It's clearly something we will need to contend with in 2026.\"\nThe S&P 500 SPX was off by 143.15 points, or 2.1%, at 6,796.86, its biggest percentage-point drop since Oct. 10, Dow Jones Market Data showed.\nThe Nasdaq COMP was off by 561.07 points, or 2.4%, at 22,954.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was off by 870.74 points, or 1.8%, at 48,488.59, FactSet data showed. Big Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of megacap stocks shedding a combined $683 billion in market capitalization - the most in a single day since Oct. 10, when Trump escalated his trade rhetoric against China.\nThe Cboe Volatility Index VIX, better known as the VIX or Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" was up by 26.7% at 20.09, finishing above its long-term average of around 19.5, FactSet data showed.\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the dollar's value against a basket of rivals, was off by 0.8% at 98.57 in recent trading after touching its lowest level of 2026. Tuesday's slump erased much of the buck's advance since Christmas Eve.\n\"The market is going to pay attention to the dollar as the harbinger of risk,\" Martin Adams said. \"If the dollar is falling, it is viewed as the anti-U.S. trade.\"\nOver the weekend, Trump said he would slap 10% tariffs on imports from eight European countries beginning next month. He later threatened tariffs as high as 200% on French wine and other products after French President Emmanuel Macron rebuffed Trump's offer to join his Gaza peace board. Trump will speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. Some European lawmakers have urged the European Union to abandon a trade deal with the U.S. An emergency leaders' summit has been scheduled for Thursday to discuss potential retaliatory measures.\nSpeaking during a press conference at Davos earlier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed the reaction to Trump's latest tariff threats. \"I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on April 2nd,\" he said. He urged trade partners not to walk away from their deals with the U.S.\nYields on long-dated Treasury notes and bonds were moving higher, while the U.S. dollar was selling off. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was up 6.4 basis points at 4.294%, according to FactSet data.\n\"I'm concerned on a lot of different levels that the president has pushed it way too far,\" Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, said Tuesday morning.\nThe 30-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was up 8.1 basis points to 4.920%, the biggest one-day rise since July, Dow Jones Market Data showed. Engelke said he thinks the yield could \"very easily\" go up to 5%.\n'Today is a warning'\nWhile it is unusual for U.S. stocks, Treasurys and the dollar to all sell off at the same time, it does happen. Dow Jones Market Data showed 18 instances in 2025 when the S&P 500 and ICE dollar index finished lower while Treasury yields rose. Before Tuesday, the last time this happened was Dec. 1.\nRichard Farr, chief market strategist at Pivotus Partners, cautioned that investors shouldn't read too much into Tuesday's selloff. A feared migration away from U.S. assets didn't pan out in 2025, even after Trump surprised global investors with his \"liberation day\" tariffs in April.\nHowever, he warned that Trump's aggressive rhetoric toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Greenland risked undermining confidence in U.S. bonds and the dollar.\n\"Today is a warning,\" Farr told MarketWatch.\nOthers said there was more at play than just the revived threat of tariffs. Farzin Azarm, managing director of equities trading at Mizuho, said stretched positioning in hot stock-market trades like semiconductor names meant the market was primed for a pullback heading into Tuesday.\n\"I don't buy the tariff concerns. The market needed this,\" he said.\nThe reaction in markets has so far been modest compared with what investors experienced in April. Back then, the S&P 500 skidded right to the edge of bear-market territory before Trump announced a 90-day pause on his tariffs.\nInternationally, the European STOXX 50 XX:SX5P fell for a third day on Tuesday, adding to its losses from Monday's session. The Japanese Nikkei 225 JP:NIK and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HK:11)each fell for a fourth straight day. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF EEM retreated as well, FactSet data showed.\nIn Japan, local government bonds were selling off hard. The yield on the Japanese 40-year bond BX:TMBMKJP-40Y surged to 4.215%, the highest yield ever recorded, according to FactSet. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nThe selloff in Japanese bonds was adding to the pressure facing riskier assets like stocks on Tuesday, Lukman Otunuga, senior markets analyst at FXTM, said in commentary shared with MarketWatch.\nFresh tariff threats could undercut expectations for global economic growth to accelerate in 2026, Otunuga added.\nBitcoin (BTCUSD) retreated below $90,000 on Tuesday shortly after the U.S. equity market opened for business. Prices for the pioneering digital currency were down 3% at $90,323 in recent trading.\nGold and silver hit a fresh round of intraday record highs as investors flocked to the smoking-hot metals trade. Most-active gold futures (GC00) gained $170.40 per troy ounce, or 3.7%, to settle at $4,765.80 an ounce.\nJoy Wiltermuth contributed.\n-Joseph Adinolfi\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump officially unveiled\nTrumpRx.gov , a transformative new government platform that gives Americans direct access to dramatically lower prices on dozens of common, high-cost brand-name prescription drugs.\nSecured through landmark\nMost-Favored-Nation\npricing agreements with leading pharmaceutical manufacturers, these deals ensure Americans pay prices aligned with the lowest in other developed nations, ending decades of overpayment and delivering immediate relief.\nStarting today, American patients \u2014 especially the millions who face high out-of-pocket costs for medications not fully covered by insurance \u2014 can access\nsubstantially lower\nprices on dozens of essential drugs via\nTrumpRx.gov . As the Trump Administration pursues the best possible deals for the American people, additional high-cost medications will be added on a rolling basis.\nKey examples of the savings include:\nGLP-1 medications \u2014 among the highest-spend drugs in the U.S. \u2014 have dramatic price reductions on TrumpRx.gov.\nThe monthly prices of\nOzempic\u00ae\nand injectable\nWegovy\u00ae\ndrop from $1,028 and $1,349, respectively, to an average of $350 and as low as $199, depending on dosage.\nThe monthly price of the\nWegovy\u00ae\npill falls from $1,349 to as low as $149, depending on dosage.\nThe monthly price of\nZepbound\u00ae\nfalls from $1,088 to an average of $346 and as low as $299, depending on dosage.\nMillions of Americans struggling with infertility often pay for fertility treatments entirely out-of-pocket. Thanks to TrumpRx.gov, they stand to save an average of $2,000+ per cycle on common medications.\nThe price of\nGonal-F\u00ae\n\u2014 one of the most commonly-used fertility drugs \u2014 falls to as low as $168 per pen, depending on dosage.\nThe price of\nCetrotide\u00ae\n\u2014 another commonly used fertility drug \u2014 falls from $316 to $22.50.\nThe price of\nOvidrel\u00ae\nfalls from $251 to $84.\nThis launch marks only the beginning.\nThe Trump Administration will be onboarding additional companies that have Most-Favored-Nation agreements and is aggressively pursuing additional agreements to expand the platform \u2014 ultimately driving even greater savings for Americans on prescription drugs.\nFor Americans who obtain their prescriptions through insurance, President Trump calls on Congress to swiftly pass his\nGreat Healthcare Plan .\nThis comprehensive reform would codify the savings from the Most-Favored-Nation initiative, lower insurance premiums, hold big insurance companies accountable, maximize price transparency, and enable coverage of TrumpRx.gov purchases under health plans \u2014 ensuring every American benefits from these historic reductions in drug costs.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/president-trump-launches-trumprx-gov-delivering-massive-immediate-savings-to-millions-of-americans/", "title": "President Trump Launches TrumpRx.gov, Delivering Massive ..."}}, {"text": "TrumpRx: See the 43 drugs available on the Trump administration's new discounted drug site - CBS News\nWatch CBS News\nPresident Trump's new\nTrumpRx online platform\nis a key part of his plan to help lower drug costs for consumers, with some polls showing two-thirds of Americans report high health care costs as their\u00a0 chief financial concern .\u00a0 Here's what to know about TrumpRx, which launched Thursday and which the White House\nsaid\nin a fact sheet will provide \"immediate relief\" to patients across the U.S. \u00a0 What is TrumpRx? The White House said\nTrumprx.gov \u00a0gives consumers \"direct access to dramatically lower prices\" on dozens of commonly used medications. The website doesn't let users buy drugs directly, but rather directs people to drugmakers' sites, where they can fill their prescriptions.\u00a0 TrumpRx notes it only \"displays discounted drug pricing offers\" and does not sell medication directly to consumers.\u00a0 \"It's a portal where someone can check if they can find a cheaper price, direct-to-consumer, from a drug manufacturer,\" Kaye Pestaina, vice president and director of KFF's patient and consumer protections program, told CBS News. \"It's not a storefront.\"\u00a0 To purchase a discounted medication, TrumpRx tells users to follow the instructions for each drug offer on the platform. Who can use TrumpRx? Anyone can use TrumpRx, provided they have a prescription. For now, however, the platform doesn't accept insurance and is limited to patients who buy medications out of their own pocket.\n\"At this time, TrumpRx discounted pricing is only available for cash-paying patients,\" the platform notes. As a result, spending on drugs through TrumpRx won't count toward a consumer's insurance deductible. Still, cheaper, direct-to-consumer options could benefit uninsured Americans, people with high deductibles and patients whose medications aren't covered by their insurance. \u00a0 \"You should not be buying drugs anymore, going forward, without at least checking to see if those medications are available at these discounted prices,\" Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Thursday.\nBy contrast, Pestaina noted that consumers might also be able to find lower drug prices through their own health insurance. \"It might be a good thing for some people, but for most folks they are paying less through insurance,\" she said. Exceptions to that might include GLP-1 medications for weight loss, where TrumpRX could lead to savings, Pestaina noted. \"Your employer might not cover these kinds of drugs, or there could be limitations.\" For example, the White House fact sheet said TrumpRx offers\nNovo Nordisk's Wegovy\npills for as little as $149 a month, down from $1,349. Consumers can also realize major savings on drugs used to treat infertility, according to the Trump administration.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has urged Congress to pass\n\"The Great Healthcare Plan,\"\nwhich he introduced in January to lower health insurance costs. The proposal would \"enable coverage of TrumpRx.gov purchases under health plans\" and reduce medical insurance costs, according to the White House. What drugs are offered?\u00a0 Consumers can currently access\n43 different drugs \u00a0through TrumpRx for a range of conditions. For instance, users seeking fertility drugs can get an 83% discount on Gonal F, a medication containing a follicle-stimulating hormone, according to the platform.\u00a0 \"Fertility drug pricing could benefit a lot of people, because they aren't typically covered by insurance, and TrumpRx offers discounts,\" Merith Basey, CEO of Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, a patient advocacy group, told CBS News. Late last year, the White House\nstruck deals\nwith more than a dozen drugmakers to participate in the coupon-like program, including AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly Genentech, Merck, Pfizer, and others.\nThe White House said it plans to strike deals with more drugmakers, expanding the list of discounted drugs available through TrumpRx. The 43 drugs on offer, along with the advertised discounts: Abrilada pen (autoimmune) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $207.60 Airsupra (respiratory) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $201 Azulfidine Tabs (rheumatology) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $99.60 Azulfidine En Tabs (rheumatology) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $130.80 Bevespi (respiratory) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $51 Cetrotide (IVF) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $22.50 Chantix (smoking cessation) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $106.20 Cleocin (antibiotic) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $94.35 Colestid (cholesterol) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $127.91 Cortef (inflammation) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $45 Cytomel (thyroid) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $6 Diflucan (antifungal) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $14.06 Duavee (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $30.30 Estring (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $249 Eucrisa (dermatologic) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $158.48 Farxiga (diabetes, cardiovascular) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $181.59 Genotropin (human growth hormone) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $89.67 Gonal F (fertility) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $168 Insulin Lispro (high blood sugar) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $25 Levoxyl (hypothyroidism) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $35.10 Lopid (cholesterol) \u2014TrumpRx price: $39.60 Medrol (inflammation) \u2014TrumpRx price: $3.15 Ngenla (human growth hormone) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $2,217 Nicotrol (smoking cessation) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $271.16 Ovidrel (fertility) \u2014TrumpRx price: $84 Ozempic Pen (diabetes, weight loss) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $199 Premarin (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $99 Premarin Vaginal Cream (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $236.65 Prempro (women's health) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $98.84 Pristiq (antidepressant) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $200.10\u00a0 Protonix (heartburn) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $200.10 Tikosyn (cardiovascular) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $336 Toviaz (bladder control) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $43.50 Vfend (antifungal) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $306.98 Viracept (antiviral) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $607.20 Wegovy (weight loss) \u2014 Pen TrumpRx price: $199 Wegovy Pill (weight loss) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $149 Xeljanz (rheumatology) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $1,518 Xigduo Xr (diabetes) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $181.59 Zarontin (anticonvulsant) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $71.10 Zavzpret (migraine treatment) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $594.84 Zepbound (weight loss, sleep apnea) \u2014 TrumpRx price $299 Zyvox (antibiotic) \u2014 TrumpRx price: $122.74\nEdited by\nAlain\nSherter\nMore from CBS News\nWhite House launches TrumpRx discounted drug site\nTrump Accounts to get their own Super Bowl ad.

Julie Le, who is listed as an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security, was assigned to Minnesota to support the Department of Justice in immigration cases after a wave of lawsuits followed mass arrests under\nDonald Trump\u2019s sweeping deportation efforts in the state. That detail is now \u201cover,\u201d\nThe Independent\nhas learned. The episode reveals the mounting frustrations among government attorneys that rarely boil over in public but are now beginning to spill out in courtrooms, where judges are increasingly\nfiring off warning signs\nabout the Trump administration\u2019s legal barrage. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks,\u201d said Le, according to a transcript from Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cAnd I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.\u201d open image in gallery A government lawyer detailed to the US Attorney\u2019s office in Minnesota has been removed from her post after breaking down in court and saying she wants to be held in contempt so she can get \u201824 hours of sleep\u2019\n( AFP via Getty Images ) A federal judge hauled government attorneys to his courtroom Tuesday to find out why ICE\nfailed to comply with several court orders\nto swiftly release wrongly detained immigrants whose cases appeared on his docket. District Judge Jerry R. Blackwell wanted to hear from the government why he shouldn\u2019t be holding officials in contempt for their \u201calarming\u201d failures. Instead, the judge heard from a lawyer who appeared to be at a breaking point. \u201cSometime I wish you would just hold me in contempt, your honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep,\u201d Le told the judge. According to court records, Le has been named as the government\u2019s attorney on more than 80 immigration cases in the state since the beginning of the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Metro Surge. Le told the judge she is simply \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the number of legal challenges from Trump\u2019s mass deportation dragnet. \u201cI am here to make sure the agency understands how important it is to comply with court orders,\u201d said Le, who reportedly appeared visibly upset during the hearing. She said it was like \u201cpulling teeth\u201d to get the Homeland Security and the Justice Department to follow court orders. In a statement to\nThe Independent , the Justice Department denied allegations that ICE isn\u2019t following court orders and blamed judges for \u201coverwhelming\u201d their own courts by failing to prepare them. The Trump administration is \u201ccomplying with court orders and fully enforcing federal immigration law\u201d after \u201cfour years of de facto amnesty\u201d under Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, a spokesperson told\nThe Independent. \u201cIf rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the government\u2019s obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn\u2019t be an \u2018overwhelming\u2019 habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe level of illegal aliens currently detained is a direct result of this Administration\u2019s strong border security policies to keep the American people safe,\u201d the person added. open image in gallery Trump\u2019s Justice Department has pushed out dozens of career prosecutors and other staff who refused to take up politically charged cases, according to watchdog groups\n( REUTERS ) Le is among several government lawyers who appear to have been forced from their jobs after frank admissions in court hearings against the Trump administration. Last year, the Justice Department\nfired an attorney\nwho the Trump administration accused of sabotaging its case against Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken removal from the United States to his home country ignited\na still-ongoing legal battle over his return and deportation. Erez Reuveni was initially placed on administrative leave last year after he expressed frustration with the government\u2019s inability to respond to the court\u2019s questions about Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and admitted that \u201che should not have been sent to El Salvador.\u201d Asked why the government could not simply ask El Salvador to return him, Reuveni replied: \u201cThe first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question.\u201d Dozens of other career prosecutors across the country were forced out over their refusals to drop cases or under pressure to bring politically charged prosecutions against the president\u2019s perceived enemies and longtime foes. At least five Trump-appointed U.S. Attorneys have resigned over political interference from the Trump administration, including prosecutors in Manhattan who were pressured to drop a case against former Mayor Eric Adams and a U.S. attorney in Virginia tasked with prosecuting New York Attorney General Letitia James. Last year, roughly 10,000 attorneys worked across the Justice Department and its components, including the FBI. The Trump administration has fired, forced out, or offered buyouts to roughly 5,500 attorneys and other Justice Department employees, according to Justice Connection, an advocacy group that has tracked departures. Meanwhile, top federal prosecutors in Minnesota\nare fleeing the office over mounting frustrations with the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration agenda. At least eight more career prosecutors are leaving the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Minnesota \u2014 one month after several others resigned\nunder pressure from the Justice Department to investigate the widow of Renee Good,\nwho was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last month. Veteran prosecutor Joseph Thompson, who was previously appointed by Trump to serve as Minnesota\u2019s acting U.S. attorney and first assistant U.S. attorney, among at least six prosecutors who left last month. Thompson reportedly objected to the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to investigate Good\u2019s killing as a civil rights matter and was outraged by an alleged demand to pursue a criminal investigation into Good, according to people familiar with the matter who spoked to\nThe New York Times.

Julie Le had been working for the Justice Department on a detail, but the U.S. attorney in Minnesota ended her assignment after her comments in court on Tuesday, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. She had been working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before the temporary assignment. At a hearing Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, for several immigration cases, Le told U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell that she wishes he could hold her in contempt of court \"so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.\" \"What do you want me to do?

Le's extraordinary remarks reflect the intense strain that has been placed on the federal court system since President Trump returned to the White House a year ago with a promise to carry out mass deportations.\nICE officials have said the surge in Minnesota has become its largest-ever immigration operation\nsince ramping up in early January.\nSeveral\nprosecutors have left\nthe U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota amid frustration with the immigration enforcement surge and the Justice Department's response to\nfatal shootings of two civilians by federal agents .\u00a0 A second wave of departures hit the Minnesota office in recent days, including prosecutors who spearheaded a $250 million fraud case. An office that saw 70 assistant U.S. attorneys during the Biden administration now has\nas few as 17.\nLe was assigned at least 88 cases in less than a month, according to online court records.\nBlackwell told Le that the volume of cases isn't an excuse for disregarding court orders. He expressed concern that people arrested in immigration enforcement operations are routinely jailed for days after judges have ordered their release from custody. \"And I hear the concerns about all the energy that this is causing the DOJ to expend, but, with respect, some of it is of your own making by not complying with orders,\" the judge told Le. Le said she was working for the Department of Homeland Security as an ICE attorney in immigration court before she \"stupidly\" volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota. She arrived on Jan. 5 and told the judge that she wasn't properly trained for the assignment.\n\"We have no guidance or direction on what we need to do,\" Le said.\u00a0 In one instance, the court had ordered a man's unconditional release, but Blackwell said he learned the government had imposed conditions that were not part of the court order. Le said trying to get it fixed was like \"pulling teeth.\" She said she wanted to resign from the job but couldn't get a replacement. \"Fixing a system, a broken system, I don't have a magic button to do it. I don't have the power or the voice to do it,\" Le said. Le and spokespeople for DHS, ICE and the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Kira Kelley, an attorney who represented two petitioners at the hearing, said the flood of immigration petitions is necessary because \"so many people being detained without any semblance of a lawful basis.\" \"And there's no indication here that any new systems or bolded emails or any instructions to ICE are going to fix any of this,\" she added.\nRead the full transcript below:\nJulie Le Court Transcript\nPage\nof\nIn:\nImmigration\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\nMinnesota\nDonald Trump\nPolitics\nSt. Paul\nMinneapolis\nFeatured Local Savings\nU.S. attorney exodus could impact Minnesota fraud investigations\nHow the U.S. attorney exodus could impact Minnesota fraud investigations\n02:20\nHow the U.S. attorney exodus could impact Minnesota fraud investigations\n(02:20)\nView CBS News In\nCBS News App\nOpen\nChrome\nSafari\nContinue", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/ice-lawyer-julie-le-this-job-sucks-minneapolis/", "title": "ICE lawyer removed from Minnesota immigration detail after ..."}}, {"text": "Student loan borrowers in default now able to keep tax refunds Skip to main content\nHome Personal Finance Cars Investing Retirement Lottery Shopping Tax Season Consumer Recalls Careers Coupons Cryptocurrency Real Estate Housing Market Embracing AI\nStudent loan borrowers in default now able to keep tax refunds Susan Tompor\nDetroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nStudent loan borrowers may face wage garnishment Millions of Americans in default on their federal student loans could soon see their wages garnished, as the U.S. Department of Education moves to restart aggressive collections. Fox - 5 Atlanta The U.S. Department of Education announced that it will delay implementing involuntary collections on federal student loans. The National Consumer Law Center said Friday's announcement \"throws a lifeline to working and middle class families.\" Student loan borrowers who are in default now have some good news when it comes to debt collection. The U.S. Department of Education announced Friday, Jan. 16, that it will delay implementing involuntary collections on federal student loans, including administrative wage garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program. It's unclear, based on the\nEducation Department's statement,\nhow long the temporary delay will last. More details will likely be ahead. It's a temporary delay, but it might help ease some worries about whether you'd immediately lose your tax refund to debt collection as the\n2026 tax season approaches. In case you missed it:\nHow seniors can boost tax refunds with new deduction on 2025 returns This tax season is expected to provide sizable refunds to many people, which could drive consumer spending and keep the economy growing. But millions of student loan borrowers in default risked seeing their wages garnished and tax refunds seized, as the long forbearance program that began during the COVID-19 pandemic unwinds and debt collection involving tax refunds and wages resumed. The change comes after much political heat from advocacy groups, including an urgent letter sent in January to the Education Department calling for a delay to avoid what groups called \"an unprecedented default crisis\" ahead. Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, said in a statement Friday that the Trump administration's earlier plan would have been \"economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt.\" \u201cAfter months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people\u2019s hard-earned money directly from their paychecks and tax refunds simply for falling behind on their student loans,\" said Canchola Ba\u00f1ez of Protect Borrowers, formerly called the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit advocacy organization. The National Consumer Law Center said Friday's announcement \"throws a lifeline to working and middle class families.\" Abby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said student loan borrowers are \"buckling under the weight of outdated student loan policies that don\u2019t reflect today\u2019s high cost of living and affordability crisis.\" She said existing policies and protections were set decades ago and have not been updated to reflect how much money people need to live on, given the sizable increases in prices and the cost of living. For example, Shafroth said, the Education Department protects only the first $217.50 per week in wages from garnishment, an amount set in 2009. Similarly, she said, the Education Department protects only the first $750 per month of Social Security benefits from seizure, a protection set in 1996. This summer, the Education Department had paused a plan to resume garnishing Social Security benefits. Without reform, she said, \"turning on collection, largely paused since 2020, would therefore put working families and older adults who fall behind on student loans at risk of being pushed into poverty by the federal government.\" Reforms, Shafroth said, should include increasing the amount of income protected for basic needs set decades ago to reflect today\u2019s much higher cost of living. According to the Education Department, the temporary delay announced Jan. 16 gives the department more time to implement major student loan repayment reforms under the Working Families Tax Cuts Act, which passed last year. And that should give borrowers more options to repay their loans to avoid debt collection. The changes include simplifying repayment options and providing an additional opportunity for borrowers to rehabilitate their federal student loans. The Working Families Act \"reduces the number of federal student loan repayment plans, eliminating a confusing maze of options and making it easier for borrowers to select either a single standard repayment plan or income-driven repayment plan that best meets their needs,\" according to the Education Department. A new income-driven repayment plan waives unpaid interest for borrowers with on-time payments whose payments do not fully cover accrued interest, the Education Department said, and that includes small matching payments from the Education Department in certain circumstances to ensure that outstanding principal is reduced each month. The new plan will be available for borrowers beginning July 1, 2026, the Education Department said. \"The delay in collections will give defaulted borrowers additional time to evaluate these new repayment options once they consolidate their loans or complete a repayment or rehabilitation agreement.\" Under the act, borrowers now have a second chance to rehabilitate a defaulted loan, allowing them to get their repayments back on track and get the loan out of default. Prior to passage of the act, the law permitted borrowers only a single shot at rehabilitation. \"The delay in collections will give defaulted borrowers additional time to begin the rehabilitation process, including the ability to rehabilitate their loan a second time,\" the Education Department said. During the delay, the department is encouraging borrowers in default to explore their options for resolving their defaulted student loans with the defaulted federal loan servicer. The department is continuing to report student loan defaults to credit reporting agencies, the Education Department said, which may adversely impact borrower credit reports. Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert and author, noted that federal income tax refunds were last offset\u00a0for defaulted federal student loans\u00a0in 2019, prior to the pandemic. About 1.4 million federal income tax refunds were offset then, he said, about 15.2% of the total number of defaulted borrowers. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was passed by Congress on March 25, 2020, suspended enforced collections for the duration of the payment pause. And there were further extensions to the payment pause. Kantrowitz estimates that almost 11 million borrowers will be in default by the end of March 2026. By his estimate, some 1.6 million borrowers likely would have had their federal income tax refunds offset. \"But, it could be more,\" he said. \"The federal government usually offsets the full income tax refund amount,\" Kantrowitz said. \"The only exception is when less than the full amount is needed to satisfy the defaulted federal student loan debt.\" Contact\u00a0personal finance columnist Susan Tompor:\u00a0 stompor@freepress.com .\u00a0Follow he r\non X @tompor.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail Share your feedback\nto help improve our site!", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2026/01/22/student-loan-collections-paused/88299000007/", "title": "Student loan borrowers in default now able to keep tax refunds"}}, {"text": "Student loans: Defaulted borrowers risk 2026 tax refunds Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Key Points The Trump administration is predicting larger tax refunds for the 2026 season due to changes in the \"big beautiful bill,\" but the millions of student loan borrowers who are behind on their payments may miss out.

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds\u00a0 $1.6 trillion . Defaulted borrowers still have time to take steps to protect their tax refunds this year, experts say. Here's what to know.\nLearn if your tax refund is at risk\nBorrowers worried about the fate of their tax refund should first make sure they know exactly how far behind they are, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. \"You are not subject to collections unless your debt is actually in default,\" Nierman said. \" Borrowers may think they are in default , but you have to miss at least nine months of payments before your loans are moved to this status.\" You can log into your account at\nStudentaid.gov\nto see how far behind you are; a pink banner on your dashboard may show up if your debt has officially reached default.\n\"If you are delinquent but not yet in default, explore all your repayment options,\" Nierman said. \"You may\nbe eligible for a more affordable payment plan based on your income.\" Enrolling in a forbearance or deferment should also stave off collection activity for a period, she added.\nIf you do learn that you're in default, contact the government's\nTreasury Offset Program's call center\nat\u00a01-800-304-3107, said Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\nBorrowers in default \"need to call right before they file their taxes,\" Taylor said.\nThe government generates a list of people who are in debt to different agencies and may have their tax refunds garnished. You'll be asked to provide your Social Security number to learn if you are on the list, Taylor said.\n\"If their name is not on the list, they're likely in the clear,\" she said.\nIf you are on the list for garnishment, you'll want to take steps right away to get current on your loans \u2014 and ideally before you file your taxes, Taylor said.\nGet current on student loans before filing taxes Getting current on your student loans or taking steps to do so may stop the government from seizing your tax refund. But it can take between 30 days and 10 months to get out of default, so some borrowers may consider\nrequesting an extension to file their tax return , Taylor said. Doing so is easy and free, and automatically extends your deadline to file federal taxes from April 15 to Oct. 15. (Borrowers who aren't sure if they'll owe taxes or receive a refund may benefit from\npreparing a mock return\nbefore the April 15 deadline. \"Filing an extension does not extend the time to pay taxes owed,\" said Kathleen Boyd, a certified financial planner and founder of Student Loan Savvy. If you do have a tax obligation, you'll need to pay by the original deadline to avoid incurring interest and penalties, she said.) You are not subject to collections unless your debt is actually in default. Nancy Nierman assistant director at EDCAP\nApplying for a loan consolidation\nis typically the fastest way to get out of default, Taylor said. The process can be completed in as little as four weeks, she added. But some defaulted borrowers may be required to make several on-time payments before they can consolidate, and not all borrowers will qualify, including some who've already consolidated their loans or are facing wage garnishment.\nConsolidating your loans, which involves repackaging your federal student debts into a new federal student loan, can also lead you to lose progress on your forgiveness timeline under some repayment plans, Taylor said.\nBorrowers may also lose out on current repayment options\nif the consolidation wraps up after June, due to Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"\nAnother way to get out of default is through\na loan rehabilitation . That process involves making \"nine voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments,\" according to the U.S. Department of Education. Those nine payments can be made over \"a period of 10 consecutive months,\" it notes on the StudentAid.gov site. If you can't finish the agreement before filing your taxes, you can try contacting your loan servicer and asking if they'll stop collection anyway, Taylor said. They may agree to do so if you start rehabilitation not long after receiving a notice of default or if you've already made five rehabilitation payments.\nAfter taking these steps, Taylor recommends calling the Treasury hotline back before submitting your taxes. If your name is no longer on the garnishment list, you can file with more peace of mind.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/student-loans-default-tax-refunds-garnishment.html", "title": "Student loans: Defaulted borrowers risk 2026 tax refunds - CNBC"}}, {"text": "Bad Bunny\u2019s halftime show \u2013 What it means for Puerto Rico Skip to main content\nHome Movies Celebrities TV Music Books Broadway Theatre Crosswords Games Entertain This!

The NFL's Bad Bunny pick for the Super Bowl halftime show was likely not politically motivated. USA TODAY's Pamela Avila explains. For three hours last summer, Wilfredo Jos\u00e9 Burgos-Matos felt like he didn\u2019t have to leave Puerto Rico again after moving away from the island 11 years ago. Bad Bunny\u2019s residency\nin San Juan last August hit Burgos-Matos like a wave of nostalgia, from the plena-style rhythm mixed with reggaeton and salsa filling \"El Choli\" coliseum to the pink casita and mountains built for the stage, bringing him back to his hometown of Aibonito, Puerto Rico.\u00a0 \u201cIt just very honestly made me kind of realize, or even dream a little bit, about staying and not having to live again and go through this diaspora mourning, or this grief of always being in constant movement outside of the island,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of a gift that that Bad Bunny gave to Puerto Ricans.\u201d Now,\nBad Bunny\nis bringing that same energy to one of the biggest global stages this weekend: the\nApple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show . Bad Bunny has repeatedly centered Puerto Rico in his music and his career, including his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d and his recent 31-date\n\u201cNo Me Quiero Ir de Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency\nin San Juan that generated millions into the island\u2019s local economy. Bad Bunny, whose name is\nBenito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio , has hinted his performance will be about unity during the trailer for the halftime show, where he danced with people from various ages and from diverse backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.\u00a0 But it will also, undoubtedly, be about Puerto Rico. \u201cBenito speaks first and foremost to Puerto Ricans, and so he doesn't really care what other people think, and I think that's part of the formula for his success,\u201d said Jorell Mel\u00e9ndez-Badillo, associate professor of Latin American and Caribbean History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Bad Bunny leans into Puerto Rican pride Over the past decade, Bad Bunny has skyrocketed to one of the world's biggest superstars, going from a local supermarket bagboy-turned-SoundCloud-rapper to the\nmost streamed artist across the globe . Through it all, he\u2019s leaned into his Puerto Ricanness.\u00a0 Boricua slang like perreo (a type of dance linked to reggaeton music), janguear (to hang out) and bichiyal (a stylish woman) are sprinkled throughout many of Bad Bunny\u2019s songs. He's worn a pava, a traditional Puerto Rican straw hat, on red carpets and in the promo for the Super Bowl. He highlighted the struggles Puerto Ricans experienced on the island following the devastating back-to-back hurricanes, including Hurricane Maria, in 2017, during a\ndocumentary-style music video\nfor his hit, \u201cEl Apagon.\u201d He\u2019s highlighted the ongoing gentrification in Puerto Rico, including in his song \u201cLo Que Le Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d on his latest album.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you have a Puerto Rican, like Bad Bunny, appear on this massive platform, it is some sort of a reminder to viewers that Puerto Rico exists,\u201d said Burgos-Matos, a Caribbean music academic. \u201cThat Puerto Ricans are not just consumers of U.S. culture or passive participants of the U.S.\u201d The rapper has also boosted\ntourism to the island . His residency last summer alone brought in estimates of\n$200 million\nto more than\n$700 million\nto Puerto Rico.\u00a0 Bad Bunny shines a light on Puerto Rico\u2019s history But Boricuas in the United States and on the island are hoping that viewers of the halftime show will do more than just Google tickets to visit the island. Instead, some are hoping it will shine a light on the island\u2019s deep history \u2013 and its complicated relationship with the United States. Burgos-Matos, who left Puerto Rico more than a decade ago to further his education and now has a doctorate, currently lives in the Bronx, \u201can extension of Puerto Rico,\u201d he said. His journey is one that many in the diaspora take.\u00a0 Roughly 5.8 million Puerto Ricans live in the United States, according to\nPew Research Center . Another 3.2 million live on the island, which is a U.S. territory, according to\nthe U.S. Census Bureau .\u00a0 \u201cThere is a lot of trauma that Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans have been enduring for the past years with, not only with the ongoing colonial status, but also the economic crisis, the mass migration, the unpayable debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThis\u2026is a form of asserting some sort of cultural survival.\u201d Mikey Cordero, an artist living in Santurce, Puerto Rico, a neighborhood in the island\u2019s capitol, said that Puerto Rico often \u201cgets pushed to the side\u201d politically and in media.\u00a0 Specifically, Cordero hopes the performance will open a conversation about \u201ccolonization\u201d and how laws in place, like the Jones Act, affect Puerto Rico\u2019s economy. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated U.S. territory, and has long been the subject of the debate on whether the island should become a state or an independent country.\u00a0 \u201cHe's giving you breadcrumbs into the Puerto Rican experience,\u201d Cordero, 42, said. \u201cI think if it brings more attention and more eyes on our story and our fight and our struggle \u2013 that's what I think even Bad Bunny wants \u2013 for you to like walk away with, to have that sense of prioritizing the Puerto Rican story.\u201d 'The more local Bad Bunny gets, the more universal he becomes' Puerto Rico\u2019s story is a relatable one.\u00a0 And some Boricuas anticipate that people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds won\u2019t feel excluded. Instead, they\u2019ll feel seen. Mel\u00e9ndez-Badillo, who collaborated with Bad Bunny by writing historical narratives for videos for the artist\u2019s latest record, said the reggaeton superstar explores themes around displacement, gentrification, and longing for home. \u201cThose are things that people can connect with regardless if they're from Puerto Rico or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the things that people from the Global South have been dealing with for a long time.\u201d D\u00e1maris Otero-Torres, an associate professor at Rutgers University\nwho is teaching a class on the Puerto Rican star, said Bad Bunny\u2019s message in his music is universal and can create solidarity, even as he makes \u201csure that people understand the richness of Puerto Rico and all the things that it has to be, not only the U.S. and its community, but the world.\u201d Him being chosen as an artist who sings and speaks almost entirely in Spanish is also a political act, Otero-Torres said, especially at a time in the United States where she says knowing another language is seen as a \u201cliability.\u201d \u201cWhy can't you open yourself to learn of the richness of the vastness of the culture? \u2026 The United States is an incredible melting pot,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeaking another language is not a liability. It enriches you.\u00a0It allows you not only to understand other cultures, but to understand your own culture in deeper ways.\u201d The more local Bad Bunny gets, the more universal he becomes, Otero-Torres, who is from the R\u00edo Piedras neighborhood in San Juan, recalled reading recently.\u00a0 \u201cI think that's true,\u201d she said.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail Share your feedback\nto help improve our site!", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2026/02/06/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-puerto-rico-impact/88302878007/", "title": "What Bad Bunny\u2019s halftime show means for Puerto Rico"}}, {"text": "MSN", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/super-bowl-lx-to-be-played-in-heart-of-silicon-valley-where-pears-sprouted-before-microprocessors/ar-AA1VBIdk", "title": "Super Bowl LX to be played in heart of Silicon Valley, where ..."}}, {"text": "Donald Trump - Wikipedia\nJump to content\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nPresident of the United States (2017\u20132021; since 2025)\n\"Trump\" redirects here.

By choosing to endorse Schlossberg, the grandson of John F. Kennedy and a prominent millennial voice, Pelosi is using her influence in a bid to shape the future of the Democratic Party. Pelosi, who is set to retire from Congress, holds a unique stance in this Democratic primary, where establishment backing is fiercely contested. Her decision to dive into the fray, especially for a member of the Kennedy family, underscores the enduring legacy and influence of the Kennedy brand in American politics. \u201cThis is a consequential moment for the country\u2014faith in our politics is fractured and trust in government is tenuous,\u201d stated Pelosi, emphasizing the need for genuine leadership. Who is Jack Schlossberg? Jack Schlossberg, 33, has emerged as an intriguing figure in the political arena. With his education from Harvard and Yale, he possesses the credentials but lacks the extensive political track record that many institutions typically value. Yet, he is not unfamiliar with the spotlight, thanks to his social media presence where he tackles contemporary issues with a blend of humor and seriousness. Social Media Influencer: Schlossberg has gained traction online, discussing a myriad of topics from mental health to political commentary. Family Legacy: His connections run deep; his mother, Caroline Kennedy, served as ambassador under both President Obama and President Biden. Political Background: While he may be viewed as an outsider, the Kennedy legacy acts as both a shield and a sword in this race. The Landscape of the Democratic Primary The Democratic primary for New York's 12th district includes a host of candidates vying for the position left vacant by Jerry Nadler. Among them are: Micah Lasher, a close ally of Nadler. Jami Floyd, an influential journalist. Alex Bores, a state assembly member. George Conway, the Republican-turned-Democrat attorney. Schlossberg's appeal lies not just in his heritage but also in his ability to resonate with younger voters\u2014an imperative demographic for the future of the party. His critical perspective on social issues positions him as a refreshing choice amid a largely seasoned political field. The Implications of an Endorsement Pelosi's endorsement serves a dual purpose: it bolsters Schlossberg's campaign while amplifying her own brand of leadership as one willing to disrupt norms for progressive change. By stepping into the primary debates, she seeks to demonstrate that the party is open to new ideas without sacrificing its foundational values. \u201cA candidacy rooted in understanding issues and delivering for the people is what we need now,\u201d Pelosi remarked, framing the current political moment. Historic Dynamics and Future Prospects As Schlossberg throws his hat into the political ring, the dynamics of family legacy versus individual merit will be a central theme of his campaign. Historically, the Kennedy name has been synonymous with progressivism, drawing both admiration and skepticism. This election cycle, with growing apathy toward traditional politics, Schlossberg's engagement will be tested. Will he capitalize on the goodwill of his family's legacy to forge a space for new, innovative policies? Or will his lack of a conventional political record be a stumbling block? A Call for Accountability Ultimately, Pelosi's endorsement of Schlossberg is more than an affirmation of his candidacy; it's a call for accountability in governance. The urgency expressed in her remarks reflects broader concerns about the political disillusionment felt by constituents across the nation. As we navigate this electoral cycle, the implications of such high-profile endorsements will significantly impact Democratic strategies moving forward. In a time when political trust hangs by a thread, leaders like Pelosi and candidates like Schlossberg must bridge the gap between legacy and new-age reforms. The stakes could not be higher.

Kennedy, for New York's 12th Congressional District. The endorsement, confirmed during a campaign event on Sunday, bolsters Schlossberg's position in a crowded Democratic primary. Pelosi's support highlights Democratic efforts to harness the Kennedy legacy amid 2026 midterm preparations. Pelosi Announces Formal Endorsement at Campaign Event Nancy Pelosi, the influential former Speaker of the\nUS\nHouse of Representatives, delivered her endorsement of Jack Schlossberg during a joint appearance at a New York campaign venue on February 8, 2026. The event, attended by over 500 supporters, union representatives, and Democratic operatives, marked Pelosi's first major primary intervention since retiring from leadership. Schlossberg, standing alongside Pelosi, thanked her for the backing, calling it a pivotal moment for his campaign. In her remarks, Pelosi emphasised Schlossberg's potential to unite voters in the district encompassing Manhattan's Upper West Side, Midtown, and landmarks like the United Nations. She stated that his candidacy addresses the \"fractured trust in government\" following recent national elections. The endorsement release, distributed to media outlets, included quotes from Pelosi praising Schlossberg's\n\"fresh perspective rooted in public service.\"\nMultiple wire services, including Associated Press and Reuters, carried live updates from the event. Political commentators reacted swiftly to the initial New York Times reporting that broke the story on February 7. Mark Halperin said in X post,\n\u201cPelosi to Endorse Jack Schlossberg, Again Backing a Kennedy for Congress https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/07/us/politics/pelosi-endorse-schlossberg-kennedy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share via @NYTimes.\u201d Pelosi's speech lasted 15 minutes, during which she recounted her own family's political history and parallels with the Kennedys. She noted her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., mayor of Baltimore, had campaigned for JFK in 1960. The crowd responded with sustained applause, and video footage showed Schlossberg embracing Pelosi at the conclusion. Campaign staff reported immediate boosts in online donations following the livestream. Jack Schlossberg's Campaign Launch and Momentum Jack Schlossberg announced his candidacy on November 12, 2025, via a video filmed against the New York City skyline. The 33-year-old Harvard Law graduate positioned himself as a \"new generation leader\" focused on housing affordability, climate action, and expanding healthcare access. Federal Election Commission filings from January 2026 show his campaign raised $3.2 million in the first quarter, surpassing initial challengers. Donors included Kennedy family friends, tech entrepreneurs, and progressive nonprofits. Schlossberg grew up in the 12th District, attending local schools before Yale University and Harvard. His resume includes a stint as a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, clerking for a federal judge, and brief journalism at Vogue magazine. He served as a US Senate page and interned for John Kerry during Kerry's presidential bid. Public records confirm his voter registration in the district since 2015. The candidate has cultivated a social media presence with over 1.2 million followers across platforms. Content includes policy discussions, fitness routines, and tributes to his grandfather JFK. A January 2026 paddleboarding video on the Hudson River garnered 500,000 views, blending personal appeal with calls for infrastructure investment. Analytics from campaign trackers indicate 70% positive sentiment in district polls post-launch. District Profile and Nadler's Retirement Impact New York's 12th Congressional District covers 14% of Manhattan's population, including affluent areas like the Upper West Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Chelsea. Redrawn after the 2020 census, it leans Democratic by a 40-point margin in presidential races. Key issues include high rents averaging $4,200 monthly, transit delays on the 1 train, and commercial real estate pressures near Times Square. Voter turnout reached 72% in 2024, above state averages. The seat became open when Representative Jerry Nadler, 78, announced retirement on September 15, 2025, after 32 years in Congress. Nadler, who led\nTrump\nimpeachment proceedings, endorsed Micah Lasher, his former counsel and New York State official. Nadler cited health reasons and a desire for \"renewed energy\" in his valedictory statement. His departure triggered a filing rush, with eight Democrats entering by the January deadline. District demographics show 65% white, 15% Asian, 10% Hispanic residents, with median income over $150,000. Recent zoning debates over luxury towers and green space preservation dominate community board meetings. Schlossberg's team has attended 25 such forums since launch, distributing literature on rent stabilisation. Crowded Democratic Primary Field Details The June 23, 2026, primary features a diverse slate. Micah Lasher, 44, brings government experience from the state attorney general's office. Assemblymember Alex Bores represents the Upper East Side with focuses on education funding. J Floyd, a broadcast journalist, emphasises media literacy and youth outreach. George Conway, 83, leverages his anti-Trump credentials from the Lincoln Project. Other entrants include a labour organiser and tech policy advocate. New York\u2019s closed primary restricts voting to enrolled Democrats, numbering 1.2 million district-wide. Early polls from Siena College place Schlossberg at 28%, Lasher at 22%, with others trailing. Fundraising totals: Schlossberg $3.2m, Lasher $2.1m, Bores $1.4m. The contest draws national donors due to the district's safe general election status. Schlossberg differentiates through family heritage, screening JFK documentaries at house parties. Critics question his thin resume, but supporters cite his articulate debate performances. A January debate at Cooper Union drew 800 attendees, with clips circulating widely. Journalists covering Capitol Hill amplified the endorsement news on social platforms. Nicholas Fandos said in X post,\n\u201cPelosi to Endorse Jack Schlossberg, Again Backing a Kennedy for Congress https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/07/us/politics/pelosi-endorse-schlossberg-kennedy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share via @NYTimes.\u201d Pelosi's Endorsement History with Kennedys Pelosi's support for Schlossberg echoes prior Kennedy endorsements. In 2020, she backed Joe Kennedy III's Massachusetts Senate challenge against Ed Markey, despite the loss. She hosted Caroline Kennedy at fundraising events during her ambassadorships. Pelosi's own dynasty includes five terms as Speaker and leadership of major legislation like the Affordable Care Act. Post-2023, Pelosi chairs advisory boards for super PACs targeting 50 House seats. Her network mobilised $100 million in 2024 cycles. Sources describe her as selective, endorsing only 10% of requested primaries. The Schlossberg pick aligns with youth recruitment drives by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Three Pelosi associates confirmed to media the endorsement brewed since December 2025 phone calls. It overrides quieter backing for Lasher from some unions. Republican strategists view the race as non-competitive but monitor for spillover enthusiasm. Schlossberg's Policy Positions and Public Engagements Schlossberg's platform includes codifying Roe v. Wade federally, $15 billion for commuter rail upgrades, and tax credits for renters. He proposes a \"Green Manhattan Initiative\" for solar panels on public buildings. At a February 4 housing forum, he pledged opposition to developer incentives without affordability mandates. He distanced from cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., criticising RFK Jr.'s Trump alignment and vaccine views in 2025 X threads. Schlossberg spoke at the 2024 DNC, praising Kamala Harris. His Profile in Courage award acceptance at JFK Library drew parallels to current challenges. Campaign infrastructure boasts 15 field offices, 2,000 volunteers, and weekly canvasses hitting 5,000 doors. Digital ads run on local news sites, emphasising \"Kennedy grit for New York.\" Media buys total $800,000 through February. Broader 2026 Midterm Landscape The 2026 midterms feature 35 Senate races and full House renewal amid President Trump's second term. Democratic retirements exceed 20, creating open seats. National trends show crowded primaries in California, Florida, and Pennsylvania. Ranked-choice voting debates surface in several states. New York's delegation faces redistricting after 2024 court rulings. Safe seats like NY-12 allow focus on turnout. GOP challengers in adjacent districts reference Schlossberg as \"celebrity nepotism.\" Democratic unity post-endorsement appears solid, per DNC memos. Voter outreach includes multilingual mailers in Spanish, Mandarin, and Russian, reflecting district diversity. Early voting starts May 2026. Analysts project 85% Democratic hold probability. Event Aftermath and Next Steps Post-endorsement, Schlossberg's war chest\ngrew\nby $750,000 overnight. TV ads debut February 10, featuring Pelosi narration. Primary debates schedule four sessions through May. Filing amendments due March 1. Pelosi plans district visits through spring, coordinating with state party chairs. Schlossberg's ground game targets young voters via campus tables at NYU and Columbia. Metrics show 15% registration spike among 18-34s. The race exemplifies generational shifts, with average candidate age 48 versus Nadler's tenure. Coverage spans CNN, MSNBC, and local outlets like NY1. Fundraising deadlines loom quarterly.

In addition to a count of making threats against the president and successors to the presidency, Mathre is also charged with receipt and distribution of child pornography. On Feb. 6, Mathre pleaded not guilty to the two counts in federal court in Toledo, records show. Magistrate Judge Darrell Clay ordered Mathre temporarily detained until his next hearing on Feb. 11. \u201cWhile arresting this man for allegedly threatening to murder the Vice President of the United States, a serious crime in and of itself, federal law enforcement discovered that he was also in possession of child sexual abuse materials,\u201d Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a\nFeb. 6 statement . In a Feb. 7 email, Neil McElroy, Mathre's lawyer, said he couldn't comment on the second child pornography charge since the government hadn't provided discovery yet. But McElroy called the first charge against Mathre \u2212 of allegedly threatening the vice president \u2212 a \"farce.\" The allegation, he said, \"may buttress the administration's narrative regarding threats of violence aimed at members of the administration.\" Mathre faces up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 for threats against the vice president, prosecutors said. The child pornography charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and up to a $250,000 fine. Vance is an Ohio native who formerly represented the state in the Senate.

The presence of ICE in the city has hurt economic activity.Credit...Yasmin Yassin for The New York TimesFeb. 4, 2026, 11:37 a.m. ET As the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota\ntakes a toll\non local businesses, whose customers and employees are staying off the streets out of fear, some public budgets heads have a message to the White House: Stop. Democratic state treasurers, auditors and comptrollers from 15 states \u2014 including two from California \u2014\nsent a letter\non Wednesday to President Trump calling for a halt to aggressive tactics that they say have depressed economic activity and tax collections. \u201cMany of our states already send more tax dollars to Washington than we receive in federal support,\u201d read the letter, whose signatories also included the fiscal officers of Maryland, Oregon and New York. \u201cWe are now expected to absorb the fiscal consequences of enforcement activities. This is not acceptable.\u201d State fiscal officers do not often weigh in as a group on law enforcement matters. They leave that to attorneys general, who frequently write collective letters and court briefs, typically with members of their own party. The letter was organized by\nFor the Long Term , a group of progressive-leaning state and local financial overseers who aim to foster economic and budgetary stability beyond the rapid churn of election cycles. The signatories said they came together when they determined that what was\nunfolding in Minnesota\ncrossed into their domain as stewards of the public purse. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. Tom Homan, Mr. Trump\u2019s border czar, said on Wednesday that the administration would\nwithdraw 700 immigration agents\nfrom Minnesota, leaving around 2,000 there. Other states have also experienced extended Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence, including Illinois, where Operation Midway Blitz\ntook place in the fall . Mike Frerichs, the state\u2019s treasurer, said sales and income taxes dipped during that period, as people fearing federal officers avoided restaurants and shops in neighborhoods like Chicago\u2019s Little Village. \u201cIf you\u2019re terrorizing people, and they think they\u2019re going to be arrested or shot, they\u2019re going to stay home, and they\u2019re not going to be spending money,\u201d Mr. Frerichs said. \u201cDonald Trump and Stephen Miller may not care about immigrants to this country, but the fear and chaos that they are sowing in our cities are having ripple effects on taxpaying Americans.\u201d Officials from other states are thinking about what might happen if ICE came through in force. \u201cThere\u2019s always concern that our state might be next,\u201d said Mike Pellicciotti, the treasurer of Washington, which has large immigrant communities in both agriculture and technology. He said ICE deployments were just one of several blows from the federal government over the past year, including\ntariffs . \u201cThis reckless economic policy is having an impact across the board,\u201d Mr. Pellicciotti said. \u201cWe\u2019re a trade-dependent state. We\u2019re a state that relies on a talented work force from around the world wanting to come.\u201d Mr. Trump has\nthreatened to withhold funding\nfor Democratic cities and states, including child care subsidies, public housing assistance and food stamps. The White House has also pulled back clean energy and other infrastructure grants, such as $205 million for the $16 billion Gateway project between New York and New Jersey. For state and local finances, the damage from the Trump administration\u2019s immigration restrictions and expanding enforcement efforts might take a while to play out, said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a think tank. Many states, especially in the Northeast and the industrial Midwest, have depended on immigration to keep their populations steady or growing. \u201cBudgets are getting tighter and if the immigration restrictions begin to crimp the tax base \u2014 we\u2019ll see in the next year or two what this looks like in terms of sales tax growth and income tax growth \u2014 then you have reason for concern,\u201d Mr. Glasgall said. The list of signatories included states that received an influx of migrants during the Biden administration, a situation that also had tremendous fiscal costs. They were borne primarily by cities like Denver, whose mayor unsuccessfully\npleaded for federal help\nas he spent tens of millions of dollars to accommodate the new arrivals. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that\nwhile the surge boosted tax revenues\nfor state and local governments, their spending went up by about $10 billion more. State fiscal officers said that current efforts to expel unauthorized immigrants have much wider implications for local economic activity because even legal residents fear being stopped and detained. \u201cAll of a sudden it presents this huge barrier to people participating in their communities,\u201d said Dave Young, Colorado\u2019s treasurer. Plus, he said, immigrants are essential to the state\u2019s work force. \u201cThe concern that I have is that so many of these people that are here performing these tremendous services that we absolutely need, if they leave Colorado put us in a pretty significant economic bind,\u201d he said.

Read Original Article Categories rationale: The article directly discusses the actions of state fiscal officers (treasurers/comptrollers) regarding federal policy (ICE crackdowns) and its impact on state finances, placing it under Jurisdictions (policy interaction) and Political Endorsements/Opposition (policy critique). Level 2 focuses on the cross-jurisdictional policy conflict and the political stance taken by the officials. Characteristics justification: The sentiment is strongly negative (-0.65) due to direct criticism of the administration's actions ('bad for business,' 'terrorizing people,' 'reckless economic policy'). The high uncertainty (0.9) stems from the officials expressing concern about future budget impacts and whether their state might be 'next' for enforcement actions. Tag relevance: The tags focus on the key actors (state treasury officials), the subject of the protest (ICE crackdowns, immigration enforcement), and the primary consequence discussed (tax revenues, economic activity). asset-types: others\nrwa: false\nentropy: 0.75\nsentiment: -0.65\nstaleness: 0.3\nrelevance: 0.1\nuncertainty: 0.9 #tax-revenues #immigration-enforcement #economic-activity #trump-administration #ice-crackdowns #state-treasury-officials #fiscal-consequences #for-the-long-term Full Analysis Share Previous Next Discussion about this post Comments Restacks Top Latest Discussions No posts Ready for more?

The Trump administration has sued to block the law, saying it violates federal powers. Democratic lawmakers in New York, California, Colorado and Oregon are considering similar laws.\nRepublican-led states lean into enforcement\nAfter Trump took office last year, many red states jumped to support the president's mass deportation efforts.\nIn Tennessee, the state\nprovides grants to law enforcement agencies\nthat work with ICE. Since that was passed last year, the number of sheriff's offices and police departments that have\nsigned a formal agreement with ICE\nhas skyrocketed.\nSponsor Message\nNow, Republican lawmakers in the state are considering making that voluntary program involuntary as part of a bigger immigration package.\nKentucky\nlawmakers are moving in the same direction.\nThis year, Tennessee is\npiloting legislation\nmade in partnership with Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, and the White House.\nOne of the policies would make it impossible for someone without legal status to buy a car, earn a nursing certificate or receive any government benefits. (Many government benefits are already off-limits to people living in the country illegally.) \"We're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail\" is how Cameron Sexton, the Republican Tennessee House speaker, explained it when announcing the legislation.\nThe Indiana Senate last week passed a measure that would tighten requirements for local agencies, including universities, to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Last month,\nNew Hampshire\ntook a page out of Tennessee's book by banning sanctuary cities, meaning cities can't impede federal immigration officers from carrying out their duties.\nBlue states limiting ICE cooperation\nSome Democratic-led states are considering\nmask bans or ID requirements\nfor federal agents. California's law on that is currently\ntied up in court .\nIllinois has a law limiting police cooperation with ICE that lawmakers say they want to expand this year. Last week, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul\nannounced legislation\nto do that, too.\nMaine has set up a\ntip line to report\nICE activity and abuses.\nDemocrats in other states, including Massachusetts, are looking at\ncreating \"safe zones\"\naround courthouses, schools, churches and hospitals\nwhere agents are not allowed to make arrests .\nIn a couple of weeks, the Minnesota Legislature will meet for the first time since the ICE surge there. Democrats say they're ready to pass a bill that would enable Minnesotans to sue federal agents, and changes to\nhelp renters\naffected by immigration enforcement avoid eviction.\nSponsor Message\nWhile Democrats control the Minnesota Senate, the state House is split between the two parties, meaning Democrats will need some Republican support to pass any new proposals.\nMawa Iqbal\nis a statehouse reporter for WBEZ and\nMarianna Bacallao\nis the power and equity reporter for WPLN.\nCorrection\nFeb. 3, 2026\nAn\u00a0earlier version of this story misspelled Stephen Miller's\u00a0first\u00a0name\u00a0as Steven.\nimmigration crackdown\nice\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail\nSponsor Message\nSponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.npr.org/2026/02/03/nx-s1-5697380/ice-immigrants-minnesota-state-law", "title": "Red and blue states move further apart on immigration ... - NPR"}}, {"text": "Feinstein Demands Barr Hand Over Whistleblower Report: This Is 'Unacceptable' | HuffPost Latest News\nSkip to Main Content \u00d7 Main Menu U.S. Edition Follow Us Terms \u00a0|\u00a0 Privacy Policy Part of HuffPost Politics. \u00a92026 BuzzFeed, Inc.

LOADING ERROR LOADING Sen.\nDianne Feinstein\n(D-Calif.) is demanding that Attorney General\nWilliam Barr\nrelease a whistleblower report that reportedly sounded the alarm on President\nDonald Trump \u2019s requests for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s help in\nsecuring the 2020 election . \u201cIf media reports are correct that President Trump delayed military aid appropriated by Congress in order to get Ukraine to investigate a political opponent, it\u2019s difficult not to see that as an abuse of presidential authority, plain and simple,\u201d Feinstein \u2015 the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee \u2015 said\nin a statement\nSaturday. Advertisement\nTrump called Zelensky in July and asked him about eight times to assist attorney\nRudy Giuliani\nwith a probe into former Vice President\nJoe Biden \u2019s son, Hunter,\nThe Wall Street Journal\nreported Friday. Trump is said to have believed that it could hamper the elder Biden\u2019s presidential bid. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has been refusing to hand over to Congress an Aug. 12 report from an intelligence officer who flagged Trump\u2019s alleged comments, according to\nThe Washington Post . The outlet reported that the White House legal counsel\u2019s office also is attempting to hide the report from Congress. Feinstein called the\nTrump administration \u2019s defiance \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cThe president is essentially saying that Congress has no right to investigate the executive branch, which is a direct attack on the separation of powers,\u201d she said. \u201cOversight is a constitutional function of Congress.\u201d Advertisement\nThe senator sent a letter to Barr on Friday \u201cdemanding that the whistleblower report be transmitted to Congress, which is required by law,\u201d she said in her statement. Feinstein also wants to know what advice may have been given to Maguire to prompt him to withhold the report. \u201cCovering this up will only make matters worse for this administration,\u201d she said. Feinstein joins a chorus of\nDemocrats\ncalling for the release\nof the report, including Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair\nMark Warner\nof Virginia and House Intelligence Committee Chairman\nAdam Schiff\nof California, who have offered the administration the opportunity to\nclear the matter up\nin the coming days. For several months, Giuliani has tried gin up suspicion surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s past position on the board of Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings, for which he was paid up to $50,000 per month,\nThe New York Times\nreported. Advertisement\nHis board membership \u2015 which began in 2014 and ended in April \u2015 has been a matter of public record for years. His membership overlapped with his father\u2019s tenure as vice president, during which time the elder Biden pushed for the ouster of Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor-general, who was helming a corruption probe into Burisma. According to the Times, during the last year of President\nBarack Obama \u2019s administration, Biden \u201cthreatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine\u2019s leaders did not dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite.\u201d No evidence has emerged, however, that Biden was aware of the Burisma investigation, and Giuliani\u2019s theory remains unfounded. Responding on Friday to Trump\u2019s alleged communication with Zelensky, Biden said if true, it would indicate that \u201cthere is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.\u201d \u201cIt means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation ... to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\u201d Related Donald Trump Politics and Government 2020 election Joe Biden\nRudy Giuliani Donald Trump Is Asking A Foreign Country To Help Him Win.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

There were 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group-stage qualifying process ended with a doubleheader in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Kosovo Slovenia Sweden - Group C Denmark Scotland Greece Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Rep of Ireland Hungary Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Malta Lithuania Group H Austria Bosnia Romania Cyprus San Marino Group I Norway Italy Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium N Macedonia Wales Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Albania Serbia Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Faroes Montenegro Gibraltar The 12 group winners qualified directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in\nUEFA Nations League\n(UNL) action played their first matches. What was decided in November? We have learned the identities of all the automatic qualifiers, along with the teams that will be competing in the playoffs for the last four spots available to European nations. GROUP A:\nGermany needed a win or a draw vs. Slovakia to seal first place in the group and qualify for the World Cup on the final day, and they took care of business in convincing fashion, winning 6-0. Slovakia now turn their attention to the UEFA playoffs. They will be joined there by third-place finishers Northern Ireland (9, plus-1), who progress as one of the four best-ranked Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. GROUP B:\nSwitzerland officially booked their place with a 1-1 draw over Kosovo, sending the Kosavars to the UEFA playoffs. Fourth-placed Sweden will get a playoff route through the Nations League. GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

GROUP C:\nIn a roller-coaster match that featured a red card and a\nScott McTominay bicycle-kick goal , Scotland snatched a victory against Denmark on the final day to qualify for their first World Cup in nearly three decades. Steve Clarke's men knew entering the match that nothing less than a win would send them through, and Kieran Tierney scored the stoppage-time goal that sealed qualification. Denmark must now win in the playoffs if they want to reach the World Cup. Scotland are heading to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\u00a0 Alan Harvey/SNS Group via Getty Images GROUP D:\nUkraine comfortably cruised past Iceland 2-0 to secure a playoff spot for the World Cup on Nov. 16. Ukraine are trying to qualify for their second World Cup, having last appeared in 2006. France had already qualified as group winners. GROUP E:\nSpain qualified with a 2-2 draw against Turkey, who are heading to the playoffs. GROUP F:\nPortugal qualified as group winners, but the real thrills came in the battle for second place, in which Ireland came from 2-1 down to beat Hungary 3-2 and seal a UEFA playoff spot thanks to Troy Parrott's hat trick. GROUP G:\nNetherlands officially locked up qualification with a 4-0 win over Lithuania. That confirmed Poland would finish in second place and enter the playoffs, regardless of their win vs. Malta. GROUP H:\nAustria qualified with a final-day draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to a 77th-minute goal from Michael Gregoritsch. Bosnia will compete in the playoffs, along with third-place finishers Romania, who advance as a UEFA Nations League group winner. Austria's draw vs. Bosnia in November sealed their World Cup place.\u00a0 Christian Hofer/Getty Images GROUP I:\nNorway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 when Erling Haaland scored twice in two minutes to propel Norway to a 4-1 victory over Italy on Nov. 16. Italy, meanwhile, now go into the March playoffs -- where they have fallen short in qualifying for the previous two World Cups. GROUP J:\nBelgium qualified as group winners, while Wales sealed second place. Wales and North Macedonia will both have a playoff route, but Wales' victory gives them better seeding, along with a home semifinal. GROUP K:\nEngland dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record and not conceding a goal. Albania sealed second place in the group and a spot in the UEFA playoffs. GROUP L:\nCroatia qualified as group winners, and Czechia earned a second place and a spot in the playoffs. Croatia will be competing at the World Cup once more after qualifying on Friday.\u00a0 Jure Makovec/Getty Images -\nCheck out the latest fixtures and results here\n|\nTables PLAYOFFS:\nThe final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams were divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the UNL group winners assigned to Pot 4, and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. All 16 teams have been confirmed.

The four-year cycle between FIFA World Cups will feature multiple editions of the Concacaf Nations League and the Concacaf Gold Cup, as well as a revamped World Cup Qualifying format. Regarding this important announcement,\u00a0 Concacaf President and FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani said :\u00a0 \u201cOver the past four-plus years, our Confederation has had both the privilege and the responsibility of preparing our members to compete in and host the largest FIFA World Cup in history, a tournament in which a record number of our nations will participate. When the World Cup concludes next summer, an extraordinary chapter of growth and achievement for our region will come to a close, ushering in an exciting new period. As we look ahead, the four-year calendar we have developed ensures that our members can continue to pursue their next goals through consistent elite competition, whether that means earning promotion in the Concacaf Nations League, qualifying for or winning the Concacaf Gold Cup, or ultimately reaching the pinnacle of our sport: the FIFA World Cup. I want to express my sincere gratitude to our 41 Member Associations for their support in shaping and embracing our calendar. This calendar, together with our expanded ecosystems for Senior Women\u2019s National Teams and men\u2019s and women\u2019s club competitions, is truly football-first and will continue to elevate and transform the game across Concacaf.\u201d\nCONCACAF NATIONS LEAGUE The Concacaf Nations League was established by the Confederation in 2018 to provide all member associations with consistent opportunities to compete in official matches throughout the four-year cycle between FIFA World Cups. The competition promotes development and delivers an exciting, region-wide tournament experience for fans.\u00a0 Since its inception, four editions of the Concacaf Nations League have taken place, featuring intense competition for the title of Concacaf Nations League Champion, promotion and relegation across the three leagues, and qualification for major centralized tournaments. The next two Concacaf Nations League editions are scheduled for 2026/27 and 2028/29. They will continue to be played under the existing three-league system and serve as the qualifying pathway to the Concacaf Gold Cup. The composition of each League will be determined based on the results of the preceding edition. Furthermore, starting in 2026/27, the competition will also introduce Finals for Leagues B and C, adding eight additional matches and bringing the total to 118.

For the first time since last year\u2019s war with Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted indirect talks over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. And for the first time, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test, just one day after letting a key nuclear arms treaty with Russia expire. Nick Schifrin reports.\nRead the Full Transcript\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nGeoff Bennett:\nWelcome to the \"News Hour.\" Today, across two continents, the U.S. confronted two very different nuclear challenges. For the first time since last year's war in Iran, U.S. and Iranian diplomats restarted diplomacy focused on that country's nuclear program.\nAmna Nawaz:\nAnd for the first time today, the U.S. accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test just one day after letting the final nuclear arms control treaty with Russia expire, Nick Schifrin been covering both stories and joins us now. So, Nick, let's start with the U.S. and Iran. What do we know about how those talks went today?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, the Trump administration has provided no readout at the moment, but in the lead-up to these talks, we heard from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the top negotiator, Steve Witkoff, that Iran must not make any nuclear fuel domestically, must restrict the range of its ballistic missiles, must end its support for proxy groups and account for highly enriched uranium that has been missing since last summer's strikes. Today, the U.S. held indirect talks. You see Witkoff there with the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, meeting Oman's foreign minister, who then met with Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who said the talks focused on nuclear weapons and were a -- quote -- \"good start.\"\nAbbas Araghchi, Iranian Foreign Minister:\nWe were able to exchange our viewpoints, to express our concerns and our interests for a possible deal between the two sides on our nuclear question.\nNick Schifrin:\nAraghchi said there would be a new round of talks. No confirmation of that from the U.S. side, which for the first time included the top U.S. military commander from the Middle East, a reminder, Amna, of President Trump's threats against Iran and that military buildup still in the region.\nAmna Nawaz:\nSo what do the experts tell you all of that means for the possibility of an actual deal?\nNick Schifrin:\nWell, that's the question I put to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is very skeptical of any deal of Iran's nuclear program, missile program, or support for proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas. Karim Sadjadpour, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: The Iranian regime still seems so intent on defying the United States and they fear that if they give into pressure, it's going to project weakness and invite even more pressure. Up until now Iran has shown no flexibility on moderating its ballistic missile program, or its regional proxies. And so the Iranian goal is to limit this conversation only to nuclear and even then to drag on the conversation.\nNick Schifrin:\nDrag on the conversation, Amna, so it doesn't get bombed by the United States. A U.S. official, though, confirms to me that Iran is trying to reconstitute its ballistic missile program. Look at the before right there and now look at the after of a missile production facility. Listen to distinguished scholar at Middlebury College Jeffrey Lewis. He's studied these kinds of images for years.\nJeffrey Lewis, Middlebury College:\nWe can see those facilities in satellite images. And so Israel attempted to destroy many of those buildings, but now they're back. It seems pretty clearly that Iran is well on its way to resuming production of its missiles.\nNick Schifrin:\nAnd U.S. officials, Amna, acknowledge that could mean Israel, if not the U.S., try and strike those missile production factories again in 2026.\nAmna Nawaz:\nLet's turn now to those allegations, accusations of a secret nuclear test by China. What exactly is the U.S. saying happened?\nNick Schifrin:\nYes, so, for the first time today, the U.S. revealed that China conducted explosive nuclear tests, including in June 2020, and sought to conceal them by putting the explosion inside an underground chamber. That would be China's first explosive test in some 25 years. Now, former senior officials told me today that they have known about that test for years. So what's interesting perhaps mostly today is the timing. The fact that China conducted that test has not been declassified until today, which happens to be the day after the U.S. let New START, the final nuclear arms control treaty, expire. The Trump administration and some experts have long argued that New START wasn't adequate because it didn't address China's growing arsenal. And so today it seems to be an attempt to try and pressure China into some kind of three-way talks with the United States and Russia about arms control overall. But, honestly, Beijing has always resisted any kind of limits on its nuclear program while it's growing its arsenal, says Jeffrey Lewis.\nJeffrey Lewis:\nChina has largely resisted entering any kind of formal talks, partly because their number is lower than the U.S. and they're in the process of catching up. But I think at a deeper and more profound level, it's because all of the things we want, predictability, transparency, these are things that China thinks are bad for it, because China is worried that, if we find them to be predictable and transparent, that we will be more comfortable pushing them around in a regional security crisis because we will know where their red lines are.\nNick Schifrin:\nWhich means no trilateral talks with China any time soon. And, tonight, I spoke to former Biden senior officials and also Republican senior arms control officials, and both argued to me that the U.S. should deploy more nuclear warheads. And now that New START has expired, they can do exactly that.\nAmna Nawaz:\nNick Schifrin starting our coverage tonight.

But for the first time, America brought its top military commander in the Middle East to the table.\nThe presence of U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the American military's Central Command, in his dress uniform at the talks in Muscat, the Omani capital, served as a reminder that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships were now off the coast of Iran in the Arabian Sea.\nPresident Trump has\nrepeatedly threatened to use force\nto compel Iran to reach a deal on the program after earlier sending the carrier to the region over Tehran's bloody\ncrackdown on nationwide protests\nthat killed thousands and saw tens of thousands of others detained in the Islamic Republic. Mr. Trump has warned Iran that an \"armada\" of American warships deployed to the region could be used, while saying he hopes it isn't necessary.\nGulf Arab nations fear a U.S. attack could spark a regional war that would drag them in as well.\nThat threat is real \u2014 U.S. forces\nshot down an Iranian drone\nnear the Lincoln and Iran\nattempted to stop a U.S.-flagged ship\nin the Strait of Hormuz just days before Friday's talks, just north of Oman's coast on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\"We did note that nuclear talks and the resolution of the main issues must take place in a calm atmosphere, without tension and without threats,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later told journalists.\nOmani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Hamad Al Busaidi, right, meets Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ahead of indirect U.S.-Iran talks in Muscat, Oman, Feb. 6, 2026.\nOman Foreign Ministry/Anadolu/Getty\n\"The prerequisite for any dialogue is refraining from threats and pressure,\" he added. \"We stated this point explicitly today as well, and we expect it to be observed so that the possibility of continuing the talks exists.\"\nThe U.S., represented by U.S. Mideast special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, did not immediately comment on the talks. Araghchi said diplomats would return to their capitals, signaling this round of negotiations was over.\nOmani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Hamad Al Busaidi, right, shakes hands with President Trump's Special Representative for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, as Jared Kushner looks on, ahead of indirect U.S-Iran talks, in Muscat, Oman, Feb. 6, 2026.\nOman Foreign Ministry/Anadolu/Getty\nAraghchi offered cautious optimism as he spoke in a live interview from Muscat on Iranian state television. He described Friday's talks as taking place over multiple rounds and said that they were focused primarily on finding a framework for further negotiations.\n\"We will hold consultations with our capitals regarding the next steps, and the results will be conveyed to Oman's foreign minister,\" Araghchi said.\n\"The mistrust that has developed is a serious challenge facing the negotiations,\" Araghchi said. \"We must first address this issue, and then enter into the next level of negotiations.\"\nOmani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who oversaw multiple rounds of negotiations before Israel launched its\n12-day war on Iran\nin June, called the talks \"useful to clarify both the Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress.\"\nStill, Oman described the talks as a means to find, \"the requisite foundations for the resumption of both diplomatic and technical negotiations,\" rather than a step toward reaching a nuclear deal or easing tensions.\nThey had initially been expected to take place in Turkey in a format that would have included regional countries as well, and would have included topics like Tehran's ballistic missile program \u2014 something Iran apparently rejected in favor of focusing only on its nuclear program.\nBefore the June war, Iran\nhad been enriching uranium up to 60% purity , a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 the U.N. nuclear watchdog \u2014 had said Iran was the only country in the world to enrich to that level that wasn't armed with the bomb.\nIran has been refusing requests by the IAEA to inspect the sites bombed in the June war, raising concern among nonproliferation experts. Even before that, Iran had restricted IAEA inspections since Mr. Trump's decision in 2018\nto unilaterally withdraw America\nfrom the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, brokered by the Obama administration.\nFriday's talks saw in-person meetings at a palace near Muscat's international airport, used by Oman in earlier talks Iran-U.S. talks in 2025. Associated Press journalists saw Iranian officials first at the palace and later returning to their hotel before the Americans came separately.\nIt remains unclear just what terms Iran is willing to negotiate at the talks. Tehran has maintained that these talks will only be on its nuclear program. However, the Al Jazeera satellite news network reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar offered Iran a proposal in which Tehran would halt enrichment for three years, send its highly enriched uranium out of the country and pledge \"not initiate the use of ballistic missiles.\"\nRussia had signaled it would take the uranium, but Iran has said ending the program or shipping out the uranium were nonstarters.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that the talks needed to include all those issues.\n\"I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out,\" he said.\nThe Standoff with Iran\nMore\nAs Iran and the U.S. eye talks, a protester asks Trump to \"keep his word\"\nU.S. tanker reportedly approached by Iranian gunboats in Strait of Hormuz\nIran's supreme leader warns of \"regional war\" in Middle East if U.S. attacks\nExplosion in Iranian port city ahead of Iran's naval drill in the Strait of Hormuz\nSatellite photos show activity at Iran nuclear sites as protest tensions rise\nGo deeper with The Free Press\nThe U.S. Provides $4 Billion a Year to Israel.
