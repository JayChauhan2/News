The advantage for November remains unclear as Florida and Virginia remain in flux. Bart Jansen\nUSA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\nTrump reacts after Indiana Senate rejects GOP redistricting plan The Indiana Senate killed the GOP redistricting bill as President Donald Trump and leaders react with both sharp criticism and praise. WASHINGTON \u2013 The jockeying between Republicans and Democrats\nfor advantage in the 2026 congressional elections\ncontinues after\nthe Supreme Court\nrefused to review\nCalifornia\u2019s redistricting plan , as another seven states are in the midst of redrawing maps for partisan gains. The\nhigh court refused on Feb. 4\nto hear a challenge to California\u2019s ballot initiative to redraw its maps in a way that could shift five House seats from Republican to Democrat. The decision\nfollowed one in December\nthat allowed Texas to use a map that could flip five seats the other way, from Democrat to Republican. The competition is fierce because the\nHouse is narrowly divided\nand Democrats could regain control of the chamber from Republicans by flipping three seats. The\u00a0 National Conference of State Legislatures \u00a0calls it the biggest flurry of\u00a0 mid-decade redistricting since the 1800s . Some states are trying to redraw maps to gain just one more seat for their leading party. The stakes are high because a change in House control from Republicans to Democrats could lead to bigger disputes over spending \u2013 after two government shutdowns in one year \u2013 and more investigations of\nPresident Donald Trump . The House has 218 Republicans and 214 Democrats. Three seats \u2013 formerly held by Republicans in Georgia and California, and a Democrat in New Jersey \u2013 are vacant. The 2026 midterm elections will decide all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate. The movement kicked off when Trump encouraged Republican-led states to redraw their maps to gain more seats. Democratic-led states embarked on their own redistricting in response, as illustrated by California\u2019s response to Texas. \u201c Donald Trump\nsaid he was \u2018entitled\u2019 to five more Congressional seats in Texas,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom\nsaid on social media on Feb. 4 . \u201cHe started this redistricting war. He lost, and he\u2019ll lose again in November.\u201d The census, which counts the U.S. population every decade, determines how many House seats each state has under the Constitution. Congressional maps are traditionally redrawn then to adjust for population shifts. The push to redraw maps in the middle of the decade is unusual. But the\nSupreme Court ruled in 2019\nthat partisan maps cannot be challenged, even if racially discriminatory maps could be. Four Republican-led states are still working on new maps: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called a special legislative session\nin April for redistricting that analysts said could hurt three to five Democratic incumbents. The GOP already controls 20 of the state's 28 U.S. House seats, after lawmakers approved a 2021 map that flipped four Democratic seats. The redistricting effort faces a legal hurdle in a constitutional amendment barring lawmakers from drawing districts purely for partisan gain. In Ohio, a quirk in state law\nrequired a new map in 2026\nbecause the previous one was approved without Democratic votes. Republicans hold 10 of the state\u2019s 15 U.S. House seats. The redistricting commission, which has five Republicans and two Democrats, unanimously approved a map in October that boosts GOP chances of flipping two Democratic districts. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed a new map into law in September that dismantled a Kansas City seat held by Democrats. Republicans now hold six of the state\u2019s eight U.S. House seats. Several organizations filed lawsuits challenging the map's legality as opponents try to force a voter referendum on it. North Carolina\u2019s\nGOP-led legislature approved a new map in October\ndesigned to flip a Democratic seat. Under state law, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein had no say in the process. Republicans hold 10 of the state\u2019s 14 U.S. House seats. Two Republican-led redistricting efforts failed: In Indiana, the\nGOP-controlled Senate rejected a map\naimed at giving all nine U.S. House seats a Republican advantage, in a rare rebuke of Trump. Democrats hold two seats now.\u00a0 In Kansas, Republicans abandoned a Trump-backed redistricting effort after state House Speaker Dan Hawkins said in January there wasn\u2019t enough support to overcome a veto threat from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Republicans hold three of the state\u2019s four U.S. House seats. Three states are working on new maps that could help Democrats: In Virginia, the Democratic-led legislature approved a constitutional amendment in January to give lawmakers the power to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map to flip as many as four seats. But the measure must still face state voters in a special election in the spring.\nA state judge blocked the map in January\nand Democrats appealed the decision. Democrats now hold six of the state\u2019s 11 U.S. House seats. In Utah, a state judge threw out a GOP-drawn map as illegally partisan. Instead, the judge implemented an alternative that could flip one of the state\u2019s four Republican-held seats to Democrats.\u00a0 In New York, a state judge ordered the independent redistricting commission in January to redraw a GOP-held district based in Staten Island, which could give Democrats a chance to flip the seat. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-New York, whose seat is at stake, appealed the ruling.\u00a0Democrats hold 19 of the state\u2019s 26 U.S. House seats. A redistricting effort in Democratic-led Maryland has stalled. The state House advanced a new map on Feb. 2 that targeted the state\u2019s only GOP seat. But state Senate President Bill Ferguson said there isn\u2019t enough support in his chamber and he doesn\u2019t plan to hold a vote on the bill.

In a self-districting system, as described herein, each voter chooses which constituency the voter wants to join for purposes of legislative representation. These constituencies can be geographically based as in traditional districting systems, but they also can be based on other attributes\u2014whatever associational communities the voters themselves wish to form. If enough voters join a constituency to form more than one district based on the constitutional principle of equally populated districts, then this constituency can be subdivided into districts based on strict computer-implemented geographical criteria without any possibility for gerrymandering. This self-districting system not only complies with the U.S. Constitution; it is also consistent with the Act of Congress that requires single-member districts. Thus, there is no federal law obstacle to prevent states from adopting a self-districting system for both their congressional delegation and their own legislative chambers. In fact, self-districting is a way to avoid the problem of minority vote dilution, a task likely to become more difficulty given anticipated changes in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the topic. Because of the increasingly pernicious nature of gerrymandered districts, which cause voters\u2014and most especially minority voters\u2014serious representational harms, the alternative of self-districting, where voters are empowered to make these representational decisions for themselves, deserves serious consideration.\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4328642\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/04/congressional-redistricting-california-texas-florida-virginia/88515239007/\nrigged gerrymander machinations in more States in 2026\n\u2014\nJ.R.\n2 TO 5 TIMES THE NUMBER OF VOTERS IN LAST REGULAR ELECTION FOR PREZ/GUV DIVIDED BT TOTAL MEMBERS IN LEGIS BODY.\n@DFR,\nHow might this work for Oklahoma\u2019s five representatives?

Imagine everyone gathered in a central location \u2013 say Worcester. When you checked-in you would be assigned a room based on your residence. We\u2019ll send you to District 7, which is a ginormous room holding a few hundred thousand people. You all vote, and elect one representative. It probably would be more efficient to have these rooms distributed throughout the state, so District 7 might be located in Salem or Brockton. Or with modern communication you could have smaller rooms located in each election precinct.\nBut back to the original idea. When you check in, you are assigned District 9, surnames ending in T-Z. This complies with the US Constitution, since the representatives are chosen by the \u201cPeople of Massachusetts\u201d so long as there are roughly the same number of voters in each room (SCOTUS has said that the people of the state can\u2019t be choosing their representatives if 200,000 choose one, and 300,000 choose another. They have said that if Massachusetts voters each had 9 votes, it would also would comply with the US Constitution). An at-large election of this sort would not comply with federal statute.\nIf Massachusetts created \u201cdistricts\u201d based on surnames it would be challenged in court. Even if it was ruled legal, Congress could change the law. But Congress could also require states to elect representatives by surname. At one time, Congress set standards for districts which include compactness and contiguity, implying areal districts. But they have eliminated those standards. Edward B. Foley, author of the law review article, asserts that \u201cdistricts\u201d formed on a basis other than area are districts.\nBut lets use a 3D model. We have a three story building in the shape of Massachusetts (or perhaps a 3-layer cake). Democrats are placed on the bottom floor, Republicans on the middle floor, and unenrolled and others on the third floor. Each voters in placed at their relative spatial position. We apportion 9 representatives: 6 unenrolled, 2 Democrats, 1 Republican. We divide the Democratic floor/layer into two rooms. The Republicans elect one representatives statewide. The unenrolled are divided into six rooms.

Sign up\nhere\nto get stories like this sent to your inbox. Less than two months before the primary season opens, it seems that both parties have a general sense of the Senate map.\u00a0 Conversations with about two dozen strategists, lobbyists, donors, and rank-and-file Hill staffers reveal the current lay of the land: Democrats see an incredibly narrow path back to the majority, one that will require the kind of luck that has been in short supply for the party of late. Republicans, meanwhile, see a more favorable map that will likely result in them retaining Senate control, although the latest\npolling\nand voter registration\ntrends\nare certainly making party leaders skittish. For the GOP, the biggest wild card is the leader of their own party, as Donald Trump has a history of backing the less-electable horse in pivotal primaries. Strategists are hoping Trump will do better this cycle at\nmaintaining\nhis\nneutrality , or at least avoid elevating the kind of candidates who are so toxic they hurt Republicans in other races. While the Senate map remains in Republicans\u2019 favor, non-presidential elections are famously tough to predict, and there is a political lifetime between now and November. Just the events of the last few weeks\u2014the military seizure of\nVenezuela\u2019s\nautocratic leader, Trump\u2019s\nthreats to Denmark\nover Greenland, a\nmounting\nnational anti-ICE backlash\u2014suggest any prediction about the midterms made in January of 2026 are slightly better than pure bunk. Advertisement First, let\u2019s dissect the Democrats\u2019 map. In a\nrecent\nstrategy memo, Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm firstly and optimistically assumes the party will hold Michigan and New Hampshire, where Democratic incumbents are choosing not to seek another term, and Georgia, where Sen. Jon Ossoff is. (To recap: the current trio of Democratic Senators previously won those seats with an average of 52% of the vote. That holds the\nstatus quo . To move Democrats back to holding the Senate\u2019s gavels, Democrats\u2019 official playbook is to pursue flips in Alaska, Maine, North Carolina, and Ohio. Six years ago, Republicans won those first three seats with 54%, 51%, and 49%. The fourth, Ohio, is going to be a special election to fill the remainder of Vice President J.D. Vance\u2019s term; he won in 2022 with 53% of the vote.\u00a0 Put candidly, the Democrats\u2019 plan for those four states is ambitious\u2014but the trends are on their side. Special elections since November 2024 have delivered a slate of wins for Democrats, who have\noutperformed\nexpectations and historical trajectories.\u00a0 Advertisement Then there are seats in Iowa and Texas that are viewed as more dreamy pick-up opportunities for Democrats. More on that below. Some of the Democrats\u2019 open doors are thanks to Trump\u2019s fickle nature. For instance, in North Carolina, Sen.\nThom Tillis\nwould have been on a glidepath to re-election. But Tillis ran afoul of Trump during the President\u2019s first tour of Washington for such sins as working with Democrats on\nreforming\nimmigration policy and\ndefending\nRobert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the 2016 elections, and\nopposing\nTrump\u2019s effort to tap emergency budget powers to bypass Congress and build the border wall. But the final blow came last summer when Tillis voted against Trump\u2019s mega-spending package, the One Big Beautiful Bill. The next day, Tillis announced he would not seek a third term. It\u2019s a similar situation in Texas, Maine, and Louisiana, where Trump is bedeviling party leaders by his decision to not endorse the incumbents viewed as best positioned to keep their seats red.\u00a0 Advertisement That said, the map is decidedly in Republicans\u2019 favor. Just holding GOP seats in Alaska, Maine, North Carolina, and Ohio is the whole ballgame. Republicans are thirstily looking for some flips of their own, like New Hampshire, where former Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts and former Sen. John E. Sununu of New Hampshire are both running for an open seat. In Georgia, it\u2019s a smorgasbord of GOP talent. And in Michigan, a Never-Trumper-turned-convert in former Rep. Mike Rogers is primed to face whoever emerges from a three-way primary that will serve as a litmus test for the Democrats. Oh, that\u2019s right. Primaries! None of these nominees are officially set. That doesn\u2019t start happening until March. The first major test will come in Texas, where everything\u2014including risk\u2014is always bigger.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a tour of the 10 states where control of the Upper Chamber will be decided. Texas\nSen. John Cornyn, a former member of GOP Leadership and a guiding voice for pragmatic conservatives on the Hill, faces a real challenge to even win his party\u2019s nomination for another six-year term when his state holds its primary on March 3. Emerson College\u2019s polling this month shows Cornyn locked in a tight primary against Attorney General Ken Paxton, with Rep. Wesley Hunt running about 10 points behind both. Still, the plurality of voters there remain undecided. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has told reporters that Trump would not be making an endorsement in that race, although it\u2019s far from assured that the President will keep his end of the bargain. Trump is fond of Paxton\u2019s pluck and Hunt\u2019s ambition. Some strategists worry that Texas Republicans may be about to trade away a reliably Republican seat if Paxton or Hunt emerge as the nominees. Advertisement The Democratic primary is also competitive, featuring feisty rising star Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico, who has drawn national attention for his\nblending of Christian faith with a pragmatic policy raft . Trump absolutely loathes Crockett, who might bait the President to intervene in the GOP primary. North Carolina A sneaky and pricey addition to the map this year, North Carolina\u2019s Senate race is the one that Republicans feel least confident defending. Michael Whatley, who served for 17 months as Trump\u2019s hand-picked chairman of the Republican National Committee, had been expected to coast into the seat being vacated by Tillis. The reasoning was sound: the last Democrat to win a Senate seat in North Carolina was elected in 2008. But Democrats landed a major recruiting win with former Gov. Roy Cooper, who ran ahead of Hillary Clinton by 4 points in 2016 and by 6 points over Joe Biden four years later. Every single poll has shown Cooper besting Whatley. But holding the seat is a top priority for Thune and Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm. The fact that Whatley is one of Trump\u2019s favorites is lost on no one, as is the fact that Democrats have won the state\u2019s presidential vote just twice since LBJ. Advertisement Ohio Oh, Ohio. The one-time swing state has sided with the presidential winner every time except for 1944, 1960, and 2020. But its status as a bellwether is far from its heyday. Sen. Jon Husted is seeking to defend the seat he inherited when J.D. Vance won the vice presidency in 2024. In picking Husted, Gov. Mike DeWine cleared some potential strife inside the state GOP he controls and set in motion what should have been a fairly easy hold. But former Sen. Sherrod Brown had other thoughts. Brown, who lost his seat in 2024, is the lone Ohio Democrat who has proven to be able to win statewide since the 2006 wave election, Brown has a machine in the state. And without Trump at the top of the ticket driving turnout, there\u2019s a good shot that the 73-year-old fixture in Ohio politics can come back to Washington. Louisiana Louisiana should be an easy hold for Republicans, but who occupies the seat has become a moving target now that Trump decided to mess with Sen. Bill Cassidy\u2019s re-nomination. The President\u2019s unexpected endorsement of Rep. Julia Letlow\u2014before she even joined the race, mind you\u2014added a complication for Cassidy, who voted to convict Trump in his impeachment over the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol yet set aside his own reservations as a doctor over the nomination of an anti-vaxxer to be the nation\u2019s health secretary. Not even that concession\u2014which has dogged Cassidy ever since\u2014was enough to satiate Trump\u2019s mounting obsession with revenge. Advertisement Thune had desperately hoped Trump would stay out of Louisiana. Just this month, Thune popped down to the state to stand with Cassidy and make stops to boost his standing. After all, Cassidy chairs the Senate health and education committee and is already playing a crucial role in steering Senate Republicans\u2019 agenda. Poking Cassidy out of spite is a very Trumpian move but not one that leaves Democrats eyeing the race with any seriousness. After all, the last time Louisiana voters sent a first-term Democrat to the Senate was 1996. Georgia This is the race that keeps Democrats up at night. Jon Ossoff is far-and-away this cycle\u2019s biggest\nfundraiser , hauling in $54 million for the cycle and showing no signs of slowing. Still, this is Georgia, a state that has voted for a Democratic White House contender just twice since Jimmy Carter\u2019s days. Trump is the big unknown here. He has yet to make an endorsement and his record in Georgia is mixed at best. (He\ndelivered\nNFL player Herschel Walker the Senate nomination in 2022 but\nfailed\nto kill Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s re-nomination that same primary.) This year, it\u2019s Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Cart", "metadata": {"source": "https://time.com/7357434/democrats-2026-elections-senate-races-donald-trump-texas-maine-michigan/", "title": "Democrats See Path to Senate Control in 2026: Watch These ..."}}, {"text": "MSN", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-chances-of-flipping-the-house-from-republicans-in-2026/ar-AA1T9Cra", "title": "Democrats' chances of flipping the House from Republicans in 2026"}}, {"text": "Use of Presidential Drawdown Authority for Military Assistance for Ukraine - United States Department of State\nSkip to content\nAn official website of the United States Government\nHere's how you know\nOfficial websites use .gov\nA\n.gov\nwebsite belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS\nA\nlock (\n)\nor\nhttps://\nmeans you\u2019ve safely connected to the .gov website.

Use of Presidential Drawdown Authority for Military Assistance for Ukraine\nhide\nUse of Presidential Drawdown Authority for Military Assistance for Ukraine\nFact Sheet\nBureau of Political-Military Affairs\nJanuary 20, 2025\nThe use of the Presidential Drawdown Authority to direct a drawdown to provide military assistance under section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) is a valuable tool of U.S. foreign policy in crisis situations. [1] \u00a0 \u00a0It allows for the speedy delivery of defense articles and services from Department of Defense stocks to foreign countries and international organizations to respond to unforeseen emergencies.\u00a0\u00a0Such assistance can begin arriving within days\u2014or even hours\u2014of approval.\nConsistent with his overall responsibilities for the direction and coordination of foreign assistance, the Secretary of State plays a central role in the initiation and coordination of these drawdowns. After initial engagement with Congress, the Secretary requests the President\u2019s authorization to notify Congress of the intent to exercise the drawdown authority under section 506(a)(1) of the FAA and seeks delegated authority from the President to make the necessary determinations and to direct the drawdown. The Department of State is also responsible for coordinating the implementation of the drawdown with the Department of Defense. For Ukraine, the Secretary has exercised authority delegated by the President to direct 55 drawdowns of defense articles and services totaling approximately $31.7 billion from DoD stockpiles since August 2021, in response to Russia\u2019s preparation to launch the February 24, 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine and continued war.\n[2]\nThroughout this process, the United States is providing Ukraine vital military assistance to defend itself against Russia\u2019s unprovoked and brutal aggression, which amounts to internationally condemned war crimes.\u00a0 In support of this effort, Congress has progressively increased the cap on this drawdown authority from $100 million to $11 billion for Fiscal Year 2022, most recently in the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-128), which was signed into law by the President on May 21. Since August 2022, the Administration has utilized this Presidential Drawdown Authority\n55\ntimes to provide military assistance to Ukraine.\nOn August 14, 2023, the Department announced the first of several packages utilizing previously authorized PDA Authority. During DoD\u2019s regular oversight of their execution of previous Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine, they discovered that they had been incorrectly overvaluing the weapons and equipment in previous PDAs that had been authorized or Ukraine. DoD then undertook a review using the appropriate accounting method, which restored $6.2 billion that can be used under Congressionally authorized drawdown authority to provide arms and equipment to meet Ukraine\u2019s urgent security requirements. As PDA is an authority, not a funding source, once notified to Congress there is no \u2018expiration date\u2019 for the provision of defense articles and services up to the value that was notified.\u00a0 Any additional space within the previously notified PDAs, identified as a result of DOD\u2019s recalculation of the value of previous PDAs therefore remains available for Ukraine regardless of the end of the fiscal year.\nOn September 26, 2024, the Department notified Congress of the intent to direct the drawdown of up to approximately $5.55 billion in defense articles and services from DoD stocks for military assistance to Ukraine under Presidential Drawdown Authority. This drawdown, if directed, will\u00a0utilize the remaining authority of the Presidential Drawdown Authority under section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance for fiscal year 2024 provided by the Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024 (Div. B, P.L. 118-50) (USSAA), which will expires on September 30, 2024. As a result of this planned drawdown, the United States will be able to continue to provide defense articles and services to Ukraine from DoD stocks under Presidential Drawdown Authority on a continual basis and remains available for Ukraine regardless of the end of the fiscal year.\nThough the delivery of assistance under a drawdown is generally much faster than under other security assistance authorities because the Defense Department already has the articles or services in-hand, it comes with similar safeguards.\u00a0 The Department vets Ukraine\u2019s security force units nominated for assistance under the drawdown.\u00a0 In compliance with the Leahy law and in coordination with the Government of Ukraine, the Department works to ensure assistance does not go to units credibly implicated in gross violations of human rights.\u00a0 As with all transfers of defense articles and services to partners under the FAA, Ukraine is bound by an agreement with the United States not to transfer such items to third parties or unauthorized users.\u00a0 In addition, the Department of Defense leads a technological security review to determine what items may be transferred without putting the U.S. warfighter\u2019s edge at risk.\u00a0 The Department is confident in Ukraine\u2019s commitment and ability to uphold these agreements.\nThe authority to provide military assistance through a drawdown has been used to support Allies and partners in crisis all over the world.\u00a0 It remains the U.S. government\u2019s most responsive tool to rapidly transfer U.S. military and other equipment in an unanticipated emergency that cannot be addressed by other means.\nA summary of the U.S. military assistance provided under drawdowns for Ukraine is available in our fact sheet on\u00a0 U.S. Security Cooperation with Ukraine .\nFor further information, please contact the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs at\nT_Outreach_PM@state.gov , and follow the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs on Twitter,\n@StateDeptPM .\n[1] \u00a0This fact sheet focuses on drawdowns for Ukraine directed\u00a0under\u00a0section 506(a)(1) of the\u00a0 Foreign Assistance Act\u00a0 \u00a0( 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1)\u00a0 ).\u00a0 The President also has other authorities to direct drawdowns from DoD or other U.S. government agency stocks to\u00a0provide assistance for\u00a0other purposes.\n[2]\u00a0 Several of these drawdowns have been in conjunction with the exercise of the authority under\u00a0section 614 of\u00a0the FAA.\nTags\nBureau of European and Eurasian Affairs\nBureau of Political-Military Affairs\nPolitical-Military Cooperation\nSecurity and Defense Cooperation\nSecurity Partnerships and Assistance\nUkraine\nBack to Top\nCookie Settings\nWe use cookies to make our website work better and improve your experience.
